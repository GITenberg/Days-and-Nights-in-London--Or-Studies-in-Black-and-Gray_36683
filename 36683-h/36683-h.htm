v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>London has vastly altered since the Author, some quarter of a
century ago, described some of the scenes which occurred nightly
in its midst of which respectable people were ignorant, which
corrupted its young men and young women, and which rendered it a
scandal and a horror to civilisation itself.&nbsp; The
publication of his work, &ldquo;The Night Side of
London&rdquo;&mdash;of which nearly eight thousand copies were
sold&mdash;did something, by calling the attention of Members of
Parliament and philanthropists to the subject, to improve the
scenes and to abate the scandal.&nbsp; As a further contribution
to the same subject, the present volume is published.&nbsp; Every
Englishman must take an interest in London&mdash;a city which it
has taken <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>nearly two thousand years to build; whose sons, to
enrich which, have sailed on every sea and fought or traded on
every land; and which apparently, as the original home and centre
of English-speaking people, must grow with the growth and
strengthen with the strength of the world.</p>

1</span>I.&mdash;THE WORLD OF LONDON.</h2>
<p>London, for a &ldquo;village,&rdquo; as old Cobbett used to
call it, is a pretty large one; and, viewed from the lowest
stand-point&mdash;that of the dull gospel according to
Cocker&mdash;may well be described as truly wonderful.&nbsp; It
eats a great deal of beef, and drinks a great deal of beer.&nbsp;
You are staggered as you explore its warehouses.&nbsp; I stood in
a granary the other day in which there were some eighty thousand
sacks of wheat; and in the Bank of England I held in my hand, for
a <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>minute&mdash;all too brief&mdash;a million of
pounds.&nbsp; It is difficult to realise what London is, and what
it contains.&nbsp; Figures but little assist the reader.</p>
<p>Perhaps you best realise what the city is as you come up the
Thames as far as London Bridge.&nbsp; Perhaps another way is to
stand on that same bridge and watch the eager hordes that cross
of a morning and return at night, and then, great as that number
is, to multiply it a hundredfold.&nbsp; A dozen miles off
gardeners tell you that there are plants that suffer from London
air and London fog.&nbsp; Indeed it is difficult to say where
London begins and where it ends.&nbsp; If you go to Brighton,
undoubtedly it is there in all its glory; when yachting far away
in the western islands of Scotland and the Hebrides, the first
signature I found in the strangers&rsquo; book at a favourite
hotel was that of Smith, of London.&nbsp; There he was, as large
as life, just as we see him any <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>day in Cheapside.&nbsp; One bitter
cold winter day I revisited, not exactly my childhood&rsquo;s
happy home, but a neighbouring sea port to which I was once much
attached.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I to myself, as I rushed
along in the train, &ldquo;how glad people will be to see me; how
bright will be the eyes into which I once loved to look, and how
warm the clasp of the hand which once thrilled through all my
being!&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! a generation had risen who knew not
Joseph.&nbsp; I dined sadly and alone at the hotel, and after
dinner made my way to the pier to mingle my melancholy with that
of the melancholy ocean.&nbsp; The wind was high; the sand in
clouds whirled madly along the deserted streets.&nbsp; At sea
even nothing was to be seen; but at the far end of the pier, with
his back turned to me, gazing over as if he wanted to make out
the coast of Holland&mdash;some hundred and fifty miles
opposite&mdash;was a short man, whom I knew at once from his <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>apoplectic
back&mdash;Brown, of Fleet Street&mdash;come there all the way
from the congenial steak puddings and whisky toddy of The
Cheshire Cheese for a little fresh air!&nbsp; I felt angry with
Brown.&nbsp; I was ready almost to throw him over into the raging
surf beneath, but I knew that was vain.&nbsp; There were
&ldquo;more to follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nowadays London and London
people are everywhere.&nbsp; What is London?&nbsp; It covers,
says one, within a fifteen-miles&rsquo; radius of Charing Cross,
so many hundred square miles.&nbsp; It numbers more than four
million inhabitants.&nbsp; It comprises a hundred thousand
foreigners from every quarter of the globe.&nbsp; It contains
more Roman Catholics than there are in all Rome; more Jews than
there are in all Palestine; and, I fear, more rogues than there
are even in America.&nbsp; On a Sunday you will hear Welsh in one
church, Dutch in another, the ancient dialect of St. Chrysostom
in another; and on a Saturday <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>you may plunge into low dancing-houses
at the East-End which put to shame anything of the kind in
Hamburg or Antwerp or Rotterdam.&nbsp; In many of the
smoking-rooms bordering on Mark Lane and Cheapside you hear
nothing but German.&nbsp; I know streets and squares inhabited by
Dutch and German Jews, or dark-eyed Italians, or excitable
Frenchmen, where</p>
<blockquote><p>The tongue that Shakespeare spake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is as little understood as Sanscrit itself.&nbsp; At any
moment I like I can rush away from all European civilisation, and
sit in a little room and smoke opium with the heathen
Chinee&mdash;whose smile all the while is &ldquo;childlike and
bland&rdquo;&mdash;as if I were thousands of miles away.&nbsp; On
the other side of St. Paul&rsquo;s I have supped with hundreds of
thieves at a time, who carry on their work as if there was no
such institution as that of the police; I have listened to the
story of the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>crowded lodgers, and I can believe anything you like to
tell me of the wealth, of the poverty, of the virtue, of the vice
of London.&nbsp; People say the metropolis has seven thousand
miles of streets.&nbsp; I have no doubt it has.&nbsp; People say
it has on Sunday sixty miles of shops open, and they may be
right; at least I have neither the time nor the inclination to
test these figures.&nbsp; It also rejoices, I hear, in as many
public-houses as, if set in a line, would reach from Charing
Cross to Portsmouth.&nbsp; The people of London read or write in
the course of a year as many as two hundred and forty millions of
letters.&nbsp; All these letters are written, all these
public-houses supported, all these streets lined with houses
inhabited by men who more or less are connected with the
city.&nbsp; It is there they live, if they sleep fifty miles
away, and it is a hard life some of them have assuredly.&nbsp; A
little while ago a poor woman was charged with <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>pawning shirts
entrusted to her to make by an East-End merchant clothier.&nbsp;
The woman pleaded that her children were so hungry that she was
tempted to pawn some of the work in the hope of being able to
redeem it by the time the whole was completed.&nbsp; The work was
machine-sewing.&nbsp; She hired the machine at half-a-crown a
week, and was paid by the prosecutor a shilling a dozen for his
shirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the magistrate; &ldquo;that is
only a penny each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all it is, sir,&rdquo; said the poor
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have to work a long day to make twelve.&nbsp;
And is it really a fact,&rdquo; said the magistrate, turning to
the merchant clothier, &ldquo;that this kind of work has fallen
into such a deplorable condition that you can get it done at so
poor a rate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;if I wanted
a hundred hands at the price <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>I could get &rsquo;em by holding up my
finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nowhere does life run to such extremes;&mdash;nowhere is there
such pauperism as in London; nowhere is there such wealth;
nowhere does man lift a sublimer face to the stars; nowhere does
he fall so low.&nbsp; In short, London may be described as
&ldquo;one of those things which no fellah can
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In beauty London now may almost vie with fair bewitching
Paris.&nbsp; In all other respects it leaves it far behind.&nbsp;
It is the brain of England, the seat of English rule, whence
issue laws which are obeyed in four quarters of the globe, and
the fountain of thought which agitates and rules the world.&nbsp;
London is the head-quarters of commerce.&nbsp; Tyre and Sidon and
Carthage, the republics of Italy, the great cities of the
Hanseatic Confederation, Flemish Ghent or Bruges, or Antwerp or
busy Amsterdam, never in <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>their canals, and harbours, and
rivers, sheltered such burdened argosies; in their streets never
saw such wealthy merchants; in their warehouses never garnered up
such stores of corn and wine and oil.&nbsp; London prices rule
the globe, and are quoted on every exchange.&nbsp; It is a city
of contrasts.&nbsp; It has its quarters where pale-eyed students
live and move and have their being, and factories where the only
thought is how best to drag out a dull mechanical life.&nbsp; It
has its underground cells where misers hide their ill-gotten
gains, and its abodes of fashion and dissipation where the
thoughtless and the gay dance and drink and sing, as if time past
taught them no lesson, and as if time to come could have no
terrors for them.&nbsp; It is a city of saints and sinners, where
God and Mammon have each their temples and their crowds of
worshippers.&nbsp; Here lie in wait the traffickers in
men&rsquo;s bodies and souls; and here live those whose <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>most anxious
care is how best to assuage the pangs of poverty, how best to
cure the delirium of disease, how most successfully to reclaim
the fallen and the prodigal, how most assiduously to guard the
young from the grasp of the destroyer&mdash;how, in the language
of the poet, to &ldquo;allure to brighter worlds and lead the
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there be a fire in Chicago, a famine in
India, a tornado in the West Indies, a wail of distress from the
North or the South, or the East or the West, London is the first
city to send succour and relief.</p>
<p>In speaking of London we sometimes mean Smaller London and
sometimes Greater London.&nbsp; To avoid confusion we must
clearly understand what is meant by each.&nbsp; Smaller London
comprises 28 Superintendent Registrars&rsquo; Districts, 20 of
them being in Middlesex, 5 in Surrey, and 3 in Kent; viz.
Kensington, Chelsea, St. George, Hanover Square, Westminster,
Marylebone, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Hampstead, Pancras, Islington, Hackney, St. Giles,
Strand, Holborn, London City, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green,
Whitechapel, St. George in the East, Stepney, Mile End and Poplar
in Middlesex; St. Saviour, Southwark, St. Olave, Southwark,
Lambeth, Wandsworth, and Camberwell in Surrey; and Greenwich,
Lewisham, and Woolwich in Kent.&nbsp; It had an estimated
population in the middle of 1878 of 3,577,304.&nbsp; Greater
London comprises in addition to the above 14 Superintendent
Registrars&rsquo; Districts, 6 of them being in Middlesex, 4 in
Surrey, 2 in Kent, and 2 in Essex; viz. Staines, Uxbridge,
Brentford, Hendon, Barnet, and Edmonton in Middlesex; Epsom,
Croydon, Kingston, and Richmond in Surrey; Bromley and Bexley in
Kent; and West Ham and Romford in Essex.&nbsp; It comprises the
whole of Middlesex, and such parishes of Surrey, Kent, Essex, and
Herts as are within 12 miles of Charing Cross.&nbsp; These <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>additional
districts had an estimated population of 872,711 in the middle of
the year 1878, so that Greater London has therefore at the
present time a population of 4,450,015.&nbsp; The population of
the United Kingdom in the middle of 1878 was estimated at
33,881,966.&nbsp; Greater London had therefore considerably more
than an eighth of the population of Great Britain and Ireland,
and more than a sixth of the population of England and
Wales.&nbsp; This large population is constantly and rapidly
increasing; the estimated increase in 1878 being 82,468.&nbsp; It
is important to note that the increase is not equal in all
parts.&nbsp; The population is decreasing within the City; within
Smaller London it goes on increasing but at a decreasing rate,
and in the outer ring the population increases steadily at an
increasing rate.&nbsp; The population of the outer circle has
increased more than 50 per cent. in the last ten years.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Even in
its narrowest definition&mdash;as the small plot of ground
between Temple Bar and Aldgate pump&mdash;what a history London
has!&nbsp; Of what scenes of glory and of shame it has been the
theatre!&nbsp; What brave men and lovely women have played their
part, heroic or the reverse, upon its stage!&nbsp; When the
City&rsquo;s greatest architect dug deep into the earth to build
the foundations of his matchless cathedral, he laid bare the
remains of nations and generations that one after another had
held the City as its own.&nbsp; First he uncovered the graves of
the early medieval Londoners; then he came to the remains of our
Saxon forefathers, of Ethelbert and St. Augustine; next were
found the remains of Romans and ancient Britons, and last of all
were found the mouldering remains of those who knew not
C&aelig;sar and the city they call Rome.&nbsp; Again, the London
of Victoria faintly resembles the London of Queen Anne, as
faintly perhaps <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>as does the Jerusalem of to-day represent the city in
which our Saviour dwelt.&nbsp; No wonder that our old chroniclers
romanced not a little, and that many of them did believe, as
Geoffrey of Monmouth writes, that London was founded by Brute, a
descendant of Eneas, eleven hundred years before Christ, and that
he called it Troy Novant, whence came the name of the people to
be called Trinobantes.&nbsp; Equally widespread and equally
unfounded was the belief that from London were shipped away
eleven thousand&mdash;some say seventy thousand&mdash;British
virgins (as an admirer of the virtues of my countrywomen I stick
to the highest figure)&mdash;whose bones may yet be seen in
Cologne&mdash;to the British warriors compelled to settle in
Armorica.&nbsp; What is clear, however, is that in London Diana
had a temple, that the Saxons won the city from the Britons, that
the Tower of London is one of the oldest buildings in <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Christendom,
and that here Roman and Dane, and Saxon and Norman have all more
or less left their mark.&nbsp; Our early monarchs trembled as
they saw how the great city grew.&nbsp; When that slobbering
James came to the throne&mdash;whom his courtiers denominated the
British Solomon&mdash;of whom bishops and archbishops testified
that his language was that of inspiration, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;England will shortly be London, and London England,&rdquo;
as he saw how people were adding house to house and street to
street, and flocking to them from all parts of England and
Scotland; yet the London of the Stuarts, neither in extent or
magnificence or wealth, bore the faintest resemblance to the
London of to-day.</p>
<p>Londoners are well looked after in the matter of taxes.&nbsp;
The ratable value of the metropolis, or rather the district of
the Metropolitan Board, is &pound;23,960,109.&nbsp; Last year it
raised in this way &pound;477,835.&nbsp; The <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>School Board
rate was something similar.&nbsp; Besides, there is a sewer rate
of twopence in the pound; a paving, watering, etc. rate of
probably ninepence; a lighting rate of threepence; then there are
rates to pay interest on the debts of extinct paving trusts; a
rate for baths and wash-houses, police rate and county rate,
making a total of almost five shillings and sixpence in the pound
on the value of a house.&nbsp; While it has an excess of
beer-shops, gin-palaces, and music-halls, it has a great
deficiency as regards church and chapel accommodation.&nbsp; In
Inner London it is calculated 955,060 sittings are
required.&nbsp; In Larger London the deficiency, it is estimated,
is much more.</p>
<p>The number of police, according to the last return, was 10,336
in the metropolis, showing an increase of 0.5 per cent. over last
year; and in the City 798, being seven over the last
returns.&nbsp; The metropolitan <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>police are in the proportion of one
for every 397 of the population of the metropolitan police
district; the City police of one for every 93 of the population,
as enumerated on the night of the census of 1871.&nbsp; The cost
of the metropolitan police was &pound;1,077,399, of which 39.9
per cent. was contributed from public revenue; the cost of the
City police was &pound;85,231, towards which no contribution was
made.&nbsp; From the criminal returns it appears that for the
metropolitan police district, with the City, the number of known
thieves and depredators, receivers of stolen goods, and suspected
persons, was 2,715, or one in 1,431 of the population, showing an
increase of 3.9 per cent. on the returns of the previous
year.&nbsp; The rule which has been followed now for 14 years,
that persons known to have been living honestly for one year at
least subsequently to their discharge after any conviction,
should not <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>be returned in the class of known thieves and
depredators, has been adhered to.&nbsp; The return of houses of
bad character in the metropolis, exclusive of those of ill-fame
and of those returned to Parliament under the Contagious Act, is
215, of which 66 are houses of receivers of stolen goods, showing
a decrease of 22 in the year.&nbsp; The total number of cases
tried at the Central Criminal Court was 10,151.&nbsp; From a
classification of offences determined summarily we learn that
there were 5,622 persons proceeded against in the City, of whom
1,093 were discharged, and the remainder convicted or otherwise
dealt with.&nbsp; There were 191 offences against the
Adulteration of Food Act in the metropolitan police district, 7
in the City; 5,874 against the Elementary Education Act, none in
the City; 1,234 cases of cruelty to animals in the metropolitan
district, 823 in the City; 33,520 persons were drunk <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>and
disorderly in the metropolitan district, 431 in the City, being
an increase over the numbers for the last year of about 1,000 in
the first instance, and 35 in the second.</p>
<p>From the prison returns we gather that the total of
commitments to Newgate for the year ended September 29th, 1877,
was 1,394 males, and 218 females, being in the case of the males
a reasonable decrease from the last year&rsquo;s numbers; to
Holloway, 1,896 males, 281 females, the latter returns including
841 males and 45 females to the civil side for debt.&nbsp; Under
the heading of expenses we have &pound;127 19s. for new
buildings, alterations, etc., in Newgate; and in Holloway,
&pound;199; ordinary repairs in Newgate came to &pound;149 11s.
4d., rent, rates, taxes, etc., &pound;121 7s.; Holloway repairs,
&pound;121 4s. 5d., rent and taxes, &pound;74 2s. 11d., with
various other charges, making a total of expenses at Newgate of
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&pound;6,514 5s. 3d.; Holloway, &pound;10,314 9s.
9d.&nbsp; From the table of funds charged with prison expenses we
learn that at Holloway the net profit of prisoners&rsquo; labour
was &pound;2,038 1s. 9d.&nbsp; The county or liberty rates
contributed &pound;83 16s. 8d. to Newgate; the City rate was
&pound;5,632 1s. 3d., the latter rate was, in respect to
Holloway, &pound;6,239 5s.&nbsp; The Treasury paid &pound;347 0s.
9d., proportion of the charge for convicted prisoners at Newgate,
&pound;1,438 17s. 6d. for those at Holloway.</p>
<p>The charitable contributions of England are to-day in excess
of what the whole revenue of the British Crown was under the
Stuarts, only two hundred years ago; over &pound;600,000 per
annum is derived from all such sources by the medical charities
of London alone; more than 1,200,000 persons, exclusive of
paupers, are annually recipient of assistance from those medical
charities.</p>
<p>In other ways also is London truly <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>wonderful.&nbsp; It seems as if the
earth toiled and moiled to simply supply her wants.&nbsp; Sail up
the Baltic and ask whither those vessels laden with tallow and
corn and flax are steering, and the answer is, The Thames.&nbsp;
Float down the Mediterranean, and the reply to the question would
be still the same.&nbsp; Ascend the grand rivers of the New
World, and the destination of the stores of beef and cheese and
wheat is still the same.&nbsp; Canada supplies us with our deals;
America with half our food; Australia with our wool; the Cape
with our diamonds; the Brazils with coffee.&nbsp; Havannah sends
her choice cigars, China her teas, Japan her lacquered and
ingenious ware, Italy her silks; and from the vineyards of
France, or the green hills that border the Rhine and the Moselle,
we are supposed to draw our supplies of sparkling wine.&nbsp;
Spain sends her sherry, Portugal her port.&nbsp; For us the spicy
breezes blow soft on Ceylon&rsquo;s isle, the <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>turtle
fattens languidly under burning suns, the whale wallows in the
trough of frozen seas, the elephant feeds in African jungles, and
the ostrich darts as an arrow across the plain.&nbsp; In the
country village, in the busy mill, on sea or on land, it is the
thought of London that fires the brain and fills the heart, and
nerves the muscle and relieves the tedium of nightly or daily
toil.&nbsp; As Cowper writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
has commerce such a mart,<br />
So rich, so thronged, so drained, and so supplied,<br />
As London&mdash;opulent, enlarged, and still<br />
Increasing London?&nbsp; Babylon of old<br />
Not more the glory of the earth than she,<br />
A more accomplished world&rsquo;s chief glory now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not our province to speculate as to the future.&nbsp;
There are men who tell us that Babylon is about to fall, and that
it is time for the elect to be off.&nbsp; It may be so.&nbsp;
Time, the destroyer, has seen many a noble city rise, and
flourish, and pass away; but <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>London, it must be admitted
nevertheless, never more truly in any sense deserves the epitaph
of &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; than at the present time.</p>
<h2><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>II.&mdash;THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE PEOPLE.</h2>
<p>The Middlesex magistrates have shut up the Argyle Rooms.&nbsp;
Mr. Bignell, who has found it worth his while to invest
&pound;80,000 in the place, it is to be presumed, is much
annoyed, and has, in some respects, reason to be so.&nbsp; Year
after year noble lords and Middlesex magistrates have visited the
place, and have licensed it.&nbsp; Indeed, it had become one of
the institutions of the country&mdash;one of the places which Bob
Logic and Corinthian Tom (for such men still exist, though they
go by other names) would be sure to visit, and such as they and
the women who were <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> will have to <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>go
elsewhere.&nbsp; It is said a great public scandal is removed,
but the real scandal yet remains.&nbsp; It is a scandal that such
a place ever flourished in the great metropolis of a land which
professes Christianity&mdash;which pays clergymen and deans, and
bishops and archbishops princely sums to extirpate that lust of
the flesh and lust of the eye and pride of life, which found
their lowest form of development in the Argyle Rooms.&nbsp; It
was a scandal that men of position, who have been born in English
homes and nursed by English mothers, and been consecrated
Christians in baptism, and have been trained at English public
schools and universities, and worshipped in English churches and
cathedrals, should have helped to make the Argyle a flourishing
institution.&nbsp; Mr. Bignell created no vice&mdash;he merely
pandered to what was in existence.&nbsp; It was men of wealth and
fashion who made the Argyle what it was.&nbsp; The Argyle closed,
the vice <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>remains the same, and it will avail little to make clean
the outside of the whited sepulchre if within there be rottenness
and dead men&rsquo;s bones.&nbsp; Be that as it may, there are
few people who will regret the defeat of Mr. Bignell and the
closing of the Argyle.&nbsp; It was not an improving spectacle in
an age that has sacrificed everything to worldly show, and that
has come to regard brougham as the one thing needful&mdash;as the
outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible
grace&mdash;as a charter of respectability to everyone who rides
in it, whether purchased by the chastity of woman or the honour
of man&mdash;to see painted and bedizened females, most of
them</p>
<blockquote><p>Born in a garret, in a kitchen bred,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>driving up in broughams from St. John&rsquo;s Wood or Chelsea
or Belgravia, with their gallants, or &ldquo;protectors,&rdquo;
to the well-known rendezvous, at a late hour, to leave a little
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>later for
the various oyster-rooms in the district, through a dense crowd
of lookers-on, drunk or sober, poor or rich, old or young, as the
case might be.&nbsp; In no other capital in Europe was such a
sight to be seen.&nbsp; The lesson taught by such a spectacle was
neither moral nor improving at first sight, and it was not well
that a young, giddy girl, with good looks, and wishing, above all
things, for fine dresses and gay society&mdash;sick at heart of
her lowly home and the dreary drudgery of daily
poverty&mdash;should there practically have learnt that if she
could but make up her mind to give her virtue to the winds, there
awaited her the companionship of men of birth and breeding and
wealth, and the gaudy, if short-lived, pomps and splendours of
successful vice.&nbsp; It is true that in the outside crowd there
were, in rags and tatters, in degradation and filth, shivering
with cold, pale with want, hideous with intemperance and <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>disease,
homeless and friendless and destitute, withered hags old before
their time, whom the policeman shrank from touching as he bade
them move on, who once were the admired of the Argyle, and the
pets and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> of England&rsquo;s gilded
youth; and here and there in the crowd, with boots in holes and
broken hat, and needy coat buttoned as far as possible to the
chin to conceal the absence of a shirt, with hands thrust in
empty pockets, sodden in face and feeble of limb, were men who
had been hauled from the Argyle to Bow Street and the gaol.&nbsp;
It is true thus side by side were the bane and the antidote; but
when did youth, flushed with wine and pleasure, pause on the road
to ruin?&nbsp; Young says:</p>
<blockquote><p>All men think all men mortal but themselves,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in like manner each man or woman in the glow of youth
feels confident that he or she can never fall, and thus rushes
madly <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>on,
ignoring the eternal truth that there is a Nemesis ever tracking
the steps of the wrongdoer, one from whose grasp we can never
escape, that the pleasures of sin are but for a season, and that
the wages of sin are death.&nbsp; By the beery dissipated crowd
outside, I say, this obvious fact had been lost sight of.&nbsp;
What they wanted to see was the women and the men as they turned
out into the streets or drove away.&nbsp; Well, that sight exists
no longer, and to a certain extent it is a gain.&nbsp; The
Haymarket in these latter days was very different and a much more
sober place than it was when the Marquis of Waterford played his
drunken pranks at Bob Croft&rsquo;s, or when the simple Windham
was in the habit of spending his time and wasting his money and
degrading an honoured name at such a place as Barns&rsquo;s or
The Blue Posts.&nbsp; Men not far advanced in life can remember
the Piccadilly Saloon, with its flashy women and medical students
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and
barristers from the Temple, and men about town and greenhorns
from the country&mdash;who in the small hours turned out into the
streets, shouting stentoriously, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go home
till morning,&rdquo; and putting their decision into execution by
repairing to the wine and coffee rooms which lined both sides of
the Haymarket and existed in all the adjacent streets.&nbsp; In
some there was a piano, at which a shabby performer was hired to
keep up the harmony of the evening and to give an appearance of
hilarity to what was after all a very slow affair.&nbsp; In
others the company were left to their own resources.&nbsp; At a
certain hour the police inspector, with a couple of constables,
would look in, and it was comic to see how unconscious he was
apparently that every trace of intoxicating drink had been
removed, as nothing remained on the tables but a few harmless
cups of coffee.&nbsp; It was not till the industrious world had
risen to the performance of <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>its daily task that the rag-tag and
bob-tail of the Haymarket retired to roost; and by the time that
earls and holy bishops and godly clergy were ready to drive down
the Haymarket to take part in meetings at Exeter Hall to send the
Gospel to the heathen abroad, not a trace was left of the
outrageous display the night before of the more fearful and
sadder forms of heathenism at home.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the
Haymarket thirty or forty years ago was an awful place;
undoubtedly it will be a little quieter now that the Argyle Rooms
are closed, and as the glory of Windmill-street has fled.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly we have gained a great deal externally by magisterial
action.&nbsp; Yet it is evident we need something more than
magisterial sanction for the interference of the police.&nbsp; I
am not partial to the men in blue.&nbsp; I doubt their efficacy
as agents for moral reform or the introduction of the
millennium.&nbsp; They can remove the symptoms, but they <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>cannot touch
the disease.&nbsp; It seems to me that they often
interfere&mdash;especially in the case of poor women&mdash;when
there is no occasion to do so; and no one, when it is requisite,
can be more stolidly blind and deaf and dumb than your ordinary
policeman.&nbsp; Police surveillance must mean more or less
police bribery.&nbsp; It was once my fate to live in a country
town and to belong to a library, which was also supported by the
superintendent of police.&nbsp; On one occasion I had a book
which had previously been in that gentleman&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
In opening it a letter fell out addressed to him.&nbsp; I did
what I ought not to have done, but as it was wide open, I read
it, as anyone would.&nbsp; It was from a publican in the town,
begging the superintendent&rsquo;s acceptance of a cask of
cider.&nbsp; Of course, on the next licensing-day no complaint
would be heard as to the character of that house.&nbsp; A
journeyman engineer, in his &ldquo;Habits and Customs of the
Working <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Classes,&rdquo; gives us similar testimony as he
describes a drinking party during prohibited hours disturbed by
the appearance of a policeman, but reassured when told by the
landlord that he is one of &ldquo;the right sort;&rdquo; which
means, continues the author, that &ldquo;he is one of that
tolerably numerous sort who, provided a publican
&lsquo;tips&rsquo; them a &lsquo;bob&rsquo; occasionally, and is
liberal in the matter of drops of something short when they are
on night duty, will not see any night-drinking that may be
carried on in his establishment as long as it is done with a show
of decency.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need say no more on that head; human
nature is the same all the world over.&nbsp; Out of the heart are
the issues of life, and no policeman or magistrate can make a
drunken people sober, or a low, sordid, and sensual race of men
and women noble and pure in thought and beautiful in life.&nbsp;
For that we look to the Christian Church in all its
branches.&nbsp; To its ministers especially we <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>appeal.&nbsp;
Let them leave theological wrangling, and the cloister where no
living voice is heard, and the well-lined study in which human
nature, when it puts in an appearance, has learned to assume a
decent and decorous mask, and see what are the amusements of the
people, not so much on the Sabbath-day, but on the
week-night.&nbsp; The Argyle was but one place out of many.&nbsp;
In our great cities there are tens of thousands who live only for
amusement, whether they be the working classes or in the higher
walks of life.&nbsp; A glance at some of these places of resort
may help us to understand what are the amusements of the people,
and whether the Church does well and wisely in stamping them with
her approval, or regarding them with her frown.&nbsp; It is how a
man spends his money, and not how he makes it, that is the true
index to his character.&nbsp; It is really impossible to imagine
amusements more foolish or more indicative of a low tone of mind
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>morally
and intellectually than those which are most patronised at the
present day.&nbsp; What pleasure can there be in watching a man
walking for a bet, or in a woman risking her neck on a
trapeze?&nbsp; Yet thousands go to see such a sight.&nbsp; Even
the theatres delight in displays equally revolting, perhaps more
so from a moral point of view.</p>
<p>When General Grant was in Moscow lately, an acrobat placed
four bottles on a high table, and on top of these a chair, which
he balanced sideways while he stood on his head on one corner of
it.&nbsp; He kept repeating this, adding one chair at a time,
until he got five on top of each other, and still showed no signs
of stopping; but General Grant got up and walked away, saying he
would rather read the death in the papers than witness it.&nbsp;
Our music-hall audiences are far more appreciative of the
amusements provided for them.</p>
<p>The stage, I have said, may not escape <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>censure.&nbsp; It has its illustrious exceptions, but,
as Mr. Chatterton has shown us, Shakespeare means bankruptcy, and
the majority of adaptations from the French are, it is admitted
on all hands, not of an improving character.&nbsp; The way also
in which the powers of the licenser are administered is, to say
the least, puzzling.&nbsp; It is impossible to represent some
subjects on the stage without injury to the morals and the
manners of the spectators.&nbsp; In Mr. Arthur Matthison&rsquo;s
adaptation of &ldquo;Les Lionnes Pauvres,&rdquo; the sin of
adultery was, it is true, held up to execration; but the license
was withheld because it was deemed undesirable to turn the
English theatre into a spectacular divorce court.&nbsp; Another
prohibited play was founded on &ldquo;La Petite Marquise,&rdquo;
in which faithlessness to the marriage vow becomes a fine art,
and virtue and honour and purity in woman is held up to
ridicule.&nbsp; A lady who has married a man very much <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>her senior,
is represented as encouraging the advances of a seducer, who,
when she throws herself in his arms, to avoid the expense of
having to keep her, sends her back to her husband; and yet the
man who forces this filth on the stage complains that he is badly
treated, and questions whether the world has ever given birth, or
ever will give birth, to any conception as obscene as that of the
old man in &ldquo;The Pink Dominoes&rdquo;&mdash;a play which, it
must be remembered, has had a most successful run upon the
stage.&nbsp; At the theatre, the same writer observes, &ldquo;I
have beheld a young man hidden in a chest spring out upon a woman
half dressed, while from her lips broke words I shudder to
repeat.&nbsp; In peril I have watched with bated breath an
attempt to commit a rape elaborately represented before the
public.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Madame! attend Monsieur,&rsquo; I have
seen a woman take a shirt in one hand, and a shift in the <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>other, and,
standing in the very centre of the stage, walk up to the float,
deliberately put the two together, then with a wild shriek,
etc.;&rdquo; and here the writer stops short.&nbsp; No one, of
course, expects people will stop away from the theatre; but why
cannot the tone of the place be a little higher, and the whole
style of the amusement more worthy of a civilised
community?&nbsp; Why cannot we have a less liberal display of
legs and bosoms, and more generally in the matter of wit?&nbsp;
There have always been admirers of good acting.&nbsp; Why should
they be ignored, and the stage lowered to the level of the
country bumpkin, the imbecile youth of the day, and his female
friends?</p>
<h2><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>III.&mdash;OUR MUSIC-HALLS.</h2>
<p>I fear the first impression made upon the mind of the careful
observer is that, as regards amusements, the mass of the people
are deteriorating very rapidly, that we are more frivolous and
childish and silly in this way than our fathers.&nbsp; One has no
right to expect anything very intellectual in the way of
amusements.&nbsp; People seek them, and naturally, as a relief
from hard work.&nbsp; A little amusement now and then is a
necessity of our common humanity, whether rich or poor, high or
low, sinner or saint; and of course, in the matter of amusements,
we must allow people a considerable latitude <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>according to
temperament and age and education, and the circumstances in which
they are placed.&nbsp; In these days no one advocates a
Puritanical restraint and an abstinence from the pleasures of the
world.&nbsp; We have a perfect right to everything that can
lighten the burden of life, and can make the heart rejoice.&nbsp;
It was not a pleasant sign of the times, however, when the people
found an amusement in bull-baiting, cock-fighting, boxing, going
to see a man hanged; nor is it a pleasant sign of the tunes when,
night after night, tens of thousands of our fellow-countrymen are
forced into shrieks of laughter by exhibitions as idiotic as they
are indecent.&nbsp; A refined and educated people will seek
amusements of a refining character.&nbsp; If the people, on the
contrary, rejoice in the slang and filthy innuendoes, and low
dancing and sensational gymnastics of the music-hall, what are we
to think?&nbsp; The music-hall is quite an invention of <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>modern
days.&nbsp; In times not very remote working men were satisfied
with going into a public-house&mdash;having there their
<i>quantum suff.</i> of less adulterated beer than they can get
now&mdash;and sometimes they got into good society at such
places.&nbsp; For instance, we find Dr. Johnson himself a kind of
chairman of an ale-house in Essex Street, Strand, where, for a
small fee, you might walk up and see the Doctor as large as life
and hear him talk.&nbsp; At a later day the bar-parlour, or
whatever it might be called, of the public-house, was the place
in which men gathered to talk politics, and to study how they
could better themselves.&nbsp; When Bamford, the Lancashire
Radical, came to town in 1817, the working men were principally
to be found discussing politics in all the London
public-houses.&nbsp; One such place he visited and describes:
&ldquo;On first opening the door,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the
place seemed dimmed by a suffocating vapour of <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>tobacco
curling from the cups of long pipes, and issuing from the mouths
of the smokers in clouds of abominable odour, like nothing in the
world more than one of the unclean fogs of the streets, though
the latter were certainly less offensive and probably less
hurtful.&nbsp; Every man would have his half-pint of porter
before him; many would be speaking at once, and the hum and
confusion would be such as gave an idea of there being more
talkers than thinkers, more speakers than listeners.&nbsp;
Presently, &lsquo;order&rsquo; would be called, and comparative
silence restored; a speaker, stranger, or citizen would be
announced with much courtesy or compliment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hear,
hear, hear,&rsquo; would follow, with clapping of hands and
knocking of knuckles on the tables till the half-pints danced;
then a speech with compliments to some brother orator or popular
statesman; next a resolution in favour of Parliamentary reform,
and a speech to <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>second it; an amendment on some minor point would
follow; a seconding of that; a breach of order by some individual
of warm temperament, half-a-dozen would rise to set him right, a
dozen to put them down; and the vociferation and gesticulation
would become loud and confounding.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such things are
out of fashion nowadays.&nbsp; Political discussion requires a
certain amount of intellectual capacity.&nbsp; In London there
are but few discussion forums now, and the leading one is so
fearfully ventilated and so heavily charged with the fumes of
stale tobacco and beer, that it is only a few who care to
attend.&nbsp; I remember when there were three very close
together and well attended.&nbsp; I remember also when we had a
music-hall in the City.&nbsp; It was not a particularly lively
place of resort.&nbsp; We used to have &ldquo;The Bay of
Biscay&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Last Rose of Summer,&rdquo; and now
and then a comic song, while the visitor indulged in his chop <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>or beef-steak
and the usual amount of alcoholic fluid considered necessary on
such occasions.&nbsp; But now we have changed all that, and the
simple-hearted frequenter of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Tavern
half-a-century back would be not a little astonished with the
modern music-hall, which differs <i>in toto c&aelig;lo</i> from
the public-house to which in old-fashioned days a plain
concert-room was attached.</p>
<p>A glance at the modern music-hall will show us whether we have
improved on our ancestors.&nbsp; In one respect you will observe
it is the same.&nbsp; Primarily it is a place in which men and
women are licensed to drink.&nbsp; The music is an after-thought,
and if given is done with the view to keep the people longer in
these places and to make them drink more.&nbsp; Externally the
music-hall is generally a public-house.&nbsp; It may have a
separate entrance, but it is a public-house all the same, and you
will find that you can <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>easily go from one to the
other.&nbsp; In the music-hall itself the facilities for drink
are on every side.&nbsp; There are generally two or three bars at
which young ladies are retained to dispense whatever beverages
may be required.&nbsp; In the stalls there are little tables on
which the patrons of the establishment place their glasses of
grog or beer.&nbsp; A boy comes round with cigars and programmes
for sale.&nbsp; All the evening waiters walk up and down
soliciting your orders.&nbsp; It is thus to the drink, and not to
the payment made for admission, that the proprietor looks to
recoup himself for his outlay&mdash;and that is
considerable.&nbsp; A popular music-hall singer makes his forty
pounds a week; not, however, by singing at one place all the
week, but by rushing from one to the other, and the staff kept at
any music-hall of any pretensions is considerable.&nbsp;
Internally, the music-hall is arranged as a theatre&mdash;with
its stage, orchestra, pit, galleries, and boxes.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said the manager of
one of the theatres most warmly patronised by the working
classes, to a clerical friend of mine, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
think I am doing good in keeping these people out of the
public-houses all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My clerical friend was compelled to yield a very reluctant
assent.&nbsp; In the case of the music-hall nothing of the kind
can be said in extenuation.&nbsp; It is only a larger and
handsomer and more attractive kind of drinking shop.&nbsp; In one
respect it may be said to have an advantage.&nbsp; Mostly of a
night, about the bars of common public-houses and gin-palaces,
there are many unfortunate women drinking either by themselves or
with one another, or with their male companions.&nbsp; In the
music-hall &ldquo;the unfortunate female&rdquo;
element&mdash;except in the more central ones, where they swarm
like wolves or eagles in search of their prey&mdash;is absent,
or, at any rate, not perceptible.&nbsp; <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The workman
takes there his wife and family, and the working man the young
woman with whom he keeps company.&nbsp; There can be no harm in
that? you say.&nbsp; I am not quite sure.&nbsp; Let me give one
case as an illustration of many similar which have come under my
own observation.</p>
<p>A girl one evening went with a friend, an omnibus conductor,
to a music-hall.&nbsp; She was well plied with drink, which
speedily took an effect on her brain, already affected by the gas
and glare, and life and bustle of the place.&nbsp; The girl was a
fine, giddy, thoughtless girl of the maid-of-all-work
order.&nbsp; In the morning when she awoke she found herself in a
strange room with her companion of the preceding night.&nbsp;
What was the result?&nbsp; She dared not go back to her
place.&nbsp; She was equally afraid to go home.&nbsp; I need not
ask the reader to say what became of her.&nbsp; Let him question
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the
unfortunate women who crowd the leading thoroughfares of a night
how they came to be what they are.&nbsp; It is a fact, I believe,
that no censorship is applied to music-hall performances, and
that the only censorship is that of the audience.&nbsp; The
audience, be it remembered, begins to drink directly the doors
are opened, and remains drinking all the time till they are
closed; and you may be sure that in a mob of two, or sometimes,
as is the case, three thousand people, that the higher is the
seasoning and the lower the wit, and the more abundant the
<i>double entendre</i>, the greater is the applause, and the
manager, who sits in an arm-chair at the back of the orchestra
and in front of the audience, takes note of that.&nbsp; In the
days of the Kembles, Mrs. Butler notes how the tendency of actors
was not so much to act well as to make points and bring down the
house.&nbsp; Especially does she deplore Braham&rsquo;s singing
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>as much to
be censured in this respect, and as unworthy of his high powers
and fame.&nbsp; In the music-hall this lower style of acting and
singing becomes a necessity.&nbsp; The people go to be amused,
and the actor must amuse them.&nbsp; If he can stand on his head
and sing, immense would be the applause.&nbsp; If he is unequal
to this, he must attempt something equally absurd, or he must
have dogs and monkeys come to his aid; and perhaps after all he
will find himself outrivalled by a Bounding Brother or a
wonderful trapeze performer.&nbsp; If the music-hall proprietor
in a northern city had prevailed on Peace&rsquo;s mistress, Miss
Thompson, to have appeared on his stage, what a fortune he would
have made.</p>
<p>The other night I went into one of the largest of our
music-halls, not a hundred miles away from what was once Rowland
Hill&rsquo;s Chapel.&nbsp; There must have been more than three
thousand people present.&nbsp; Not <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>a seat was to be had, and there was
very little standing room.&nbsp; I paid a shilling for admission,
and was quite surprised to see how entirely the shilling seats or
standing places were filled with working men, many of whom had
their wives and sweethearts with them.&nbsp; The majority, of
course, of the audience was made up of young men, who, in the
course of the evening spent at least another shilling in beer and
&ldquo;baccy.&rdquo;&nbsp; In these bad times, when people, in
the middle ranks of life are in despair at the hard prospect
before them, here were these working men spending their two
hundred pounds a night at the least at this music-hall.</p>
<p>When I managed to squeeze my way in it was about the hour of
ten, when men who have to get up early to work ought to be in
bed.&nbsp; The performances were in full swing, and the
enthusiasm of the audience, sustained and stimulated by
refreshment, <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>was immense.&nbsp; A female or two were the worse for
liquor, but otherwise by that time the intoxicating stage had not
been gained.&nbsp; After some very uninteresting bicycling by
riders in curious dress, a man disguised as a nigger sang a lot
of low doggerel about his &ldquo;gal.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course
of his singing he stopped to tell us that his &ldquo;gal&rdquo;
had a pimple and that he liked pimples, as they were signs of a
healthy constitution.&nbsp; He then, amidst roars of laughter,
pretended to catch a flea.&nbsp; He liked fleas, he said; a flea
came in the daylight and looked you in the face like a man as it
bit you; but a bug he hated.&nbsp; It crawled over your body in
the dark and garroted you.&nbsp; Then he went on to speak in a
mock-heroic style of the rights of women.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;spotted&rdquo; some naughty ones present&mdash;an allusion
received with laughter.&nbsp; He loved them all, male or female,
married or single, and advised all <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the young men present to get married
as soon as possible and then hang themselves.&nbsp; Ballet
dancing of the usual character followed, and I came away.</p>
<p>It is said a paper recently sent a special correspondent to
describe a London music-hall; the description was refused
admission into the paper on the ground of indecency, and I can
well believe it.</p>
<p>As to the profit made by the music-halls there can be no
doubt.&nbsp; Take for instance the London Pavilion.&nbsp; I find
the following newspaper paragraph: Sir Henry A. Hunt, C.B., the
arbitrator in the case of the London Pavilion Music Hall, has
sent in his award.&nbsp; M. Loibl claimed &pound;147,000 for the
freehold and goodwill, the building being required for the new
street from Piccadilly to Oxford Street.&nbsp; The award is
&pound;109,300.&nbsp; The freehold cost M. Loibl &pound;8,000,
and his net profits in 1875 were &pound;10,978; in 1876,
&pound;12,083; and in 1877, <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>&pound;14,189.&nbsp; Let me give
another illustration.&nbsp; When the proprietor of Evans&rsquo;
Supper Rooms was refused his license, his loss was estimated at
&pound;10,000 per annum.&nbsp; It surely evidently is more ready
to pay liberally for the gratification of its senses, than for
the promotion of its virtues.</p>

54</span>IV.&mdash;MORE ABOUT MUSIC-HALLS.</h2>
<p>The journeyman engineer tells us one day as he was walking
along with a mate in the country, he spoke of the beauty of the
surrounding scenery and of the magnificent sight which met their
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, blow the sights of the scenery,&rdquo;
said his companion, &ldquo;the sight for me is a
public-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the same everywhere.&nbsp; I was
once travelling in a third-class carriage from Newry to Belfast,
when I heard the most atrocious exclamations from a party of
young men seated at the other end, all offering to break each
other&rsquo;s heads in the name of the Holy Father.&nbsp; On my
intimating that it was a <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>pity young men should thus get into
that state to a respectable farmer by my side, his only reply
was, &ldquo;Sure, what&rsquo;s the good of a drop of drink if it
don&rsquo;t raise something?&rdquo;&nbsp; Once upon a time I
spent a Sunday in a little village inn in North Wales.&nbsp; To
my disgust there stumbled into the little parlour a young man,
dressed respectably, who had evidently been heavily
drinking.&nbsp; As he lay there with his stertorous snore, all
unconscious of the wonder and the beauty of the opening day, it
seemed to me that it was a sad misuse of the term to say, as his
friends would, that he had been in search of amusement.&nbsp; As
a reverend divine took his seat in a train the other day there
stumbled into it a couple of young fellows, one with his face
very much bruised and cut about&mdash;who soon went off to
sleep&mdash;while his companion explained to the minister that
they had both of them been enjoying themselves.&nbsp; In the more
densely populated and poorer districts <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of the metropolis there is an immense
deal of this kind of enjoyment.</p>
<p>To see the people enjoying themselves, I went the other night
down the Whitechapel and Commercial Road district.&nbsp; As I
turned the corner of Brick Lane I asked a tradesman of the better
class if he could direct me to a very celebrated music-hall in
that neighbourhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is over that way,&rdquo; said
he with a strong expression of disgust.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
regular sink of iniquity,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; As I was not
aware of that, I merely intimated my regret that it was so
largely patronised by working men, and that so much money was
thus wasted, which might be applied to a better purpose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said my informant, &ldquo;they
don&rsquo;t think of that&mdash;they know there is the hospital
for them when they are ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; On my remarking that I
was going to Brick Lane prior to visiting the music-hall, he
intimated that I had better button up my coat, and when <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>I said that
when out on such expeditions as I was then engaged in, I never
carried a watch and chain worth stealing, he remarked that if the
people did not rob me, at any rate they might knock me
down.&nbsp; However, encouraged by his remarks that the people
were not so bad as they were, I went on my way.</p>
<p>Apparently the improvement of which my informant spoke was of
a very superficial character.&nbsp; Coming from the Aldgate
Station at the early hour of six, I found every drinking shop
crammed, including the gaudy restaurant at the station, and
descending to the filthiest gin-palace, there were the men
drinking, and if they were not drinking they were loafing about
in groups of by no means pleasant aspect.&nbsp; When at a later
hour I returned, the sight was still sadder, as hordes of wild
young girls, just emancipated from the workshop, were running up
and down the streets, <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>shrieking and howling as if
mad.&nbsp; As most of the shops were then closed, the streets
seemed almost entirely given over to these girls and their male
friends.&nbsp; In the quarter to which I bent my steps the naval
element was predominating, and there were hundreds of sailors
cruising, as it were, up and down, apparently utterly unconscious
that their dangers at sea were nothing to those on land.&nbsp;
Men of all creeds and of all nations were to be encountered in
search of amusement, while hovered around some of the most
degraded women it is possible to imagine&mdash;women whose
bloated faces and forms were enough to frighten anyone, and to
whom poor Jack, in a state of liquor, is sure to become a
prey.&nbsp; To the low public-houses of this district
dancing-rooms are attached, and in them, as we may well suppose,
vice flourishes and shows an unabashed front.&nbsp; I must say it
was with a feeling of relief that I found a harbour <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>of refuge in
the music-hall.&nbsp; Compared with the streets, I must frankly
confess it was an exchange for the better.&nbsp; On the payment
of a shilling I was ushered by a most polite attendant into a
very handsome hall, where I had quite a nice little leather
arm-chair to sit in, and where at my ease I could listen to the
actors and survey the house.&nbsp; The place was by no means
crowded, but there was a good deal of the rough element at the
back, to which, in the course of the evening&rsquo;s amusement,
the chairman had more than once to appeal.&nbsp; From the
arrangements made around me, it was evident that there was the
same provision which I have remarked elsewhere for the drinking
habits of the people.&nbsp; There was a side bar at which the
actors and actresses occasionally appeared on their way to or
from the stage, and affably drank with their friends and
admirers.&nbsp; The other day I happened to hear a thief&rsquo;s
confession, and <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>what do you think it was?&nbsp; That it was his mingling
with the singers off the stage that had led to his fall.&nbsp; He
was evidently a smart, clever, young fellow, and had thought it a
sign of his being a lad of spirit to stand treat to such
people.&nbsp; Of course he could not afford it, and, of course,
he had a fond and foolish mother, who tried to screen him in his
downward career.&nbsp; The result was he embezzled his
employer&rsquo;s money, and, when that was discovered,
imprisonment and unavailing remorse were the result.&nbsp; To the
imagination of raw lads there is something wonderfully attractive
in the music-hall singer, as, with hat on one side and in costume
of the loudest character, and with face as bold as brass, he
sings, &ldquo;Slap, bang! here we are again!&rdquo; or takes off
some popular theatrical performer or some leading actor on a
grander stage.&nbsp; On the night in question one singer had the
audacity to assume as much as <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>possible the character of the Premier
of our day, not forgetting the long gray coat by which the Earl
of Beaconsfield is known in many quarters.&nbsp; Comic singing,
relieved by dancing, seemed to be the staple amusement of the
place, and when one of the female performers indecently elevated
a leg, immense was the applause.&nbsp; All the while the
performances were going on, the waiters were supplying their
customers with drink, and one well-dressed woman&mdash;evidently
very respectable&mdash;managed a couple of glasses of grog in a
very short while.&nbsp; But mostly the people round me were quiet
topers, who smoked and drank with due decorum, and who seemed to
use the place as a kind of club, where they could sit comfortably
for the night, and talk and listen, and smoke or drink, at their
pleasure.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to say that the majority
of the audience were young men.&nbsp; The attendance was not <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>crowded.&nbsp; Perhaps in the east of London the
pressure of bad times is being felt.&nbsp; The mock Ethiopian
element, next to the dancing, was the feature of the
evening&rsquo;s amusements which elicited the most
applause.&nbsp; It is a curious thing that directly a man
lampblacks his face and wears a woollen wig, and talks broken
English, he at once becomes a popular favourite.</p>
<p>A few nights after I found myself in quite another part of
London&mdash;in a music-hall that now calls itself a theatre of
varieties.&nbsp; It was a very expensive place, and fitted up in
a very costly manner.&nbsp; You enter through an avenue which is
made to look almost Arcadian.&nbsp; Here and there were little
rustic nooks in which Romeo and Juliet would make love over a
cheerful glass.&nbsp; Flunkeys as smart almost as Lord
Mayors&rsquo; footmen took your orders.&nbsp; It was late when I
put in an appearance, <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>and it was useless to try and get a
seat.&nbsp; It was only in the neighbourhood of the refreshment
bar that I could get even standing room, and being a little
taller than some of the stunted half-grown lads around me, could
look over their heads to the gaudy and distant stage.&nbsp; I did
not hear much of the dialogue.&nbsp; Old Astley, who years before
had lived in that neighbourhood, and knew the art of catering for
the people, used to remark when the interest of the piece seemed
to flag, &ldquo;Cut the dialogue and come to the
&rsquo;osses,&rdquo; and here the stage direction evidently was
to set the ballet-girls at work, and it seemed to me that the
principal aim of the piece was to show as many female arms and
legs as was possible.&nbsp; I am not of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
opinion that it is indecent for a woman to expose herself on the
stage, but I was, I own, shocked with the heroine of the evening,
whose too solid form in the lime-light&mdash;<a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>which was
used, apparently, to display all her beauties&mdash;was arrayed
in a costume, which, at a distance, appeared to be of
Paradisaical simplicity, more fitted for the dressing-room of the
private mansion than for the public arena of the stage.&nbsp;
There was, I doubt not, animated dialogue, and the swells in the
stalls, I daresay, enjoyed it; but for my shilling I could see
little, and hear less; and weary of the perpetual flourish of
female arms and legs, I came away.&nbsp; What I did most
distinctly hear were the orders at the bar for pale ale and grog,
and the cry of the waiter, as he pushed on with his tray well
filled, of &ldquo;By your leave,&rdquo; to the crowd on each
side&mdash;all of whom had, of course, a cigar or short pipe in
their mouths, and were evidently young men of the working
class.&nbsp; That evening&rsquo;s amusement, I am sure, must have
taken some two or three hundred pounds out of their
pockets.&nbsp; But I saw <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>no one the worse for liquor, though
the public-houses all round were crowded with drunken men and
women; for the morrow was Sunday, and who can refuse the
oppressed and over-taxed working man his right to spend all his
week&rsquo;s wages on a Saturday night?</p>
<p>One night last winter I was at a meeting held in the Mission
Hall, Little Wild Street, at which some three hundred thieves had
been collected together to supper.&nbsp; One of them, who had
seen the evil of his ways, said: &ldquo;The greatest curse of my
life was the music-halls.&nbsp; They have been the means of my
ruin;&rdquo; and the way in which that speech was received by his
mates evidently testified to the fact that the experience of many
was of a similar character.&nbsp; I said to him afterwards that I
knew the music-hall to which he referred, and that I had
calculated that on an average each man spent there two shillings
a night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>sir,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I
spent a great deal more than that of a night.&rdquo;&nbsp; If so,
I may assume that he spent as much as four shillings a
night&mdash;and that, as the place was his favourite haunt after
office-hours, he was there every night in the week, this would
make an expenditure of one pound four shillings&mdash;a sum, I
imagine, quite as much as his wages as a poor clerk.&nbsp; What
wonder is it that the silly youth became a thief, especially when
the devil whispers in his ear that theft is easy and the chance
of detection small?&nbsp; The one damning fact which may be
charged against all music-halls is that their amusements are too
high in price, and that every device is set to work to make
people spend more money than the cost of the original
admission.&nbsp; In the theatre you may sit&mdash;and most people
do sit all the evening&mdash;without spending a penny.&nbsp; In
the music-hall a man does not <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>like to do that.&nbsp; He drinks for
the sake of being sociable, or because the waiter solicits him,
or because he has drunk already and does not like to leave off,
or because he meets doubtful company at the bar, or because the
burden of every song is that he must be a &ldquo;jolly pal&rdquo;
and that he must enjoy a cheerful glass.&nbsp; I can remember
when at one time the admission fee included the cost of a pint of
beer or some other fluid.&nbsp; Now drink is an extra, and as the
proprietor of the music-hall, to meet the competition all round
him, has to beautify his hall as much as possible, and to get
what he calls the best available talent, male or
female&mdash;whether in the shape of man or ass, or dog or
elephant, or monkey&mdash;he is of course put to a considerable
extra expense; and that of course he has to get out of the public
the best way he can.&nbsp; No one loves to work for nothing, and
least of all the proprietor of a music-hall.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Talking
of &ldquo;pals&rdquo; and &ldquo;a cheerful glass&rdquo; reminds
me of a scene which made me sick at the time, and which I shall
not speedily forget.&nbsp; On the night of the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Show, I entered a music-hall in the north of London&mdash;in a
region supposed to be eminently pious and respectable, and not
far from where Hick&rsquo;s Hall formerly stood.&nbsp; As I saw
the thousands of people pushing into the Agricultural Hall, to
see the dreary spectacle of an insane walking match, and saw
another place of amusement being rapidly filled up, I said to
myself: &ldquo;Well, there will be plenty of room for me in the
place to which I am bound;&rdquo; and it was with misgiving that
I paid the highest price for admission&mdash;one
shilling&mdash;to secure what I felt, under the circumstances, I
might have had at a cheaper rate.&nbsp; Alas! I had reckoned
without my host.&nbsp; The hour for commencing had not arrived,
and yet the place was full to overflowing.&nbsp; <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Mostly the
audience consisted of young men.&nbsp; As usual, there were a
great many soldiers.&nbsp; It is wonderful the number of soldiers
at such places; and the spectator would be puzzled to account for
the ability of the private soldier thus to sport his lovely
person did not one remember that he is usually accompanied by a
female companion, generally a maid-of-all-work of the better
class, who is too happy to pay for his aristocratic amusements,
as she deems them, on condition that she accompanies him in the
humble capacity of a friend.&nbsp; Soldiers, I must do them
justice to say, are not selfish, and scorn to keep all the good
things to themselves.&nbsp; As soon as they find a neighbourhood
where the servant &ldquo;gal&rdquo; is free with her wages, they
generally tell each other of the welcome fact, and then the
Assyrian comes down like the wolf on the fold.</p>
<p>Well, to continue my story.&nbsp; On the <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>night, and at
the place already referred to, they were a very jolly
party&mdash;so far as beer and &ldquo;baccy&rdquo; and crowded
company and comic singing were concerned.&nbsp; They had a couple
of Brothers, who were supposed to be strong in the delineation of
Irish and German character, but as their knowledge of the
language of the latter seemed simply to be confined to the
perpetually exclaiming &ldquo;Yah, yah!&rdquo; I had misgivings
as to their talents in that respect, which were justified
abundantly in the course of the evening.&nbsp; Dressed something
in the style of shoeblacks, and wearing wooden shoes, which made
an awful noise when they danced, the little one descries his
long-lost elder brother, to whom his replies are so smart and
witty that the house was in a roar of laughter, in which I did
not join, as I had heard them twice already.</p>
<p>After they had finished we had a disgustingly stout party, who
was full of praise <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>of all conviviality, and who, while he sang, frisked
about the stage with wonderful vivacity and with as much grace as
a bull in a china-shop, or a bear dancing a hornpipe.&nbsp; As he
sang, just behind me there was all at once a terrible noise; the
chairman had to call out &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; the spectators
began howling, &ldquo;Turn him out;&rdquo; the singer had to
stop, the roughs in the gallery began to scream and cheer, and
the bars were for a wonder deserted.&nbsp; In so dense a crowd it
was so difficult to see anything, that it was not at once that I
discovered the cause of the disorder; but presently I saw in one
of the little pews, into which this part of the house was divided
(each pew having a small table in the middle for the liquor) a
couple of men quarrelling.&nbsp; All at once the biggest of
them&mdash;a very powerful fellow of the costermonger
type&mdash;dealt his opponent&mdash;a poor slim, weedy lad of the
common shop-boy <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>species&mdash;a tremendous blow.&nbsp; The latter tried
to retaliate, and struggled across the table to hit his man, but
he merely seemed to me to touch his whiskers, while the other
repeated his blow with tremendous effect.&nbsp; In vain the
sufferer tried to get out of the way; the place was too crowded,
and with a stream of blood flowing from his nose he fell, or
would have fallen, to the earth had not some of the bystanders
dragged him a few yards from his seat.&nbsp; Then as he lay by me
drunk, or faint, or both, unable to sit up or to move, with the
blood pouring down his clothes and staining the carpet all round,
I saw, as the reader can well believe, a commentary on the
singer&rsquo;s Bacchanalian song of a somewhat ironical
character; but business is business, and at the music-hall it
will not do to harrow up the feelings of the audience with such
sad spectacles.&nbsp; Perfectly insensible, the poor lad was
carried out, <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>while a constable was the means of inducing his muscular
and brutal-looking opponent to leave the hall.&nbsp; Order
restored, the stout party bounded on to the stage, and the
hilarity of the evening&mdash;with the exception of here and
there a girl who, evidently not being used to such places, was
consequently frightened and pale and faint for awhile&mdash;was
as great as ever.&nbsp; The comic singer made no reference to the
unfortunate incident; all he could do was to say what he had got
by heart, and so he went on about the cheerful glass and the fun
of going home powerfully refreshed at an early hour in the
morning, and much did the audience enjoy his picture of the poor
wife waiting for her husband behind the door with a poker,
assisting him upstairs with a pair of tongs, and after she had
got him sound asleep meanly helping herself to what cash remained
in his pocket.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>For my
part, I candidly own I felt more inclined to sympathise with the
wife than with her husband; but the music-hall is bound to stand
up for drinking, for it is by drinking that it lives.&nbsp; If
people cared for music and the drama, they would go to the
theatre; but that declines, and the music-hall flourishes.&nbsp;
Astley&rsquo;s Theatre is a case in point.&nbsp; That has been an
old favourite with the public.&nbsp; At one time, I should
imagine, few places paid better&mdash;does not Ducrow sleep in
one of the most magnificent monuments in Kensal Green, and did he
not make his money at Astley&rsquo;s?&mdash;but now there are two
flourishing music-halls one on each side of Astley&rsquo;s, and
as I write I see one of the proprietors, as a plea why he should
be given more time for the payment of a debt, admits that
sometimes they lose at Astley&rsquo;s as much as forty pounds a
week.&nbsp; If Astley&rsquo;s is to <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>be made to pay, evidently the sooner
it is turned into a music-hall the better.</p>
<p>Will the London School Boards raise the character of the
future public? is a question to be asked but not to be answered
in our time.&nbsp; The real fact is that amusements have a
deteriorating effect on the character of those who devote
themselves to them, and become more frivolous as they become more
popular.&nbsp; This is the case, at any rate, as regards
music-halls.&nbsp; A gentleman the other day, as we were speaking
of one of the most successful of them, said how grieved he was on
a visit to it lately to see the generally lowered tone of
entertainment.&nbsp; At one time the attempt was made to give the
people really good music, and there were selections of operas of
first-rate character.&nbsp; Now all that is done away with, and
there is nothing but silly comic singing of the poorest kind.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>In
another respect also there has been a deterioration&mdash;that
is, in the increased sensationalism of the performance.&nbsp; A
music-hall audience requires extra stimulus&mdash;the appetite
becomes palled, and if a leap of fifty feet does not &ldquo;fetch
the public,&rdquo; as Artemus Ward would say, why then, the leap
must be made a hundred; and really sometimes the spectacles held
up for the beery audience to admire are of the most painful
character.&nbsp; I have said that the doubtful female element is
not conspicuous in the music-hall&mdash;that is the case as
regards those on the outskirts of London, but the nearer you
approach the West-End the less is that the case; and there is
more than one music-hall I could name which is little better than
a place of assignation and rendezvous for immoral women, and
where you may see them standing at the refreshment bars
soliciting a drink from all who pass.&nbsp; Such music-halls <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>are amongst
the most successful of them all, and the proprietor reaps a
golden harvest.</p>
<p>I presume it is impossible to tell the number of our
metropolitan music-halls, or to give an idea of the numbers who
frequent them, and of the amount of money spent in them during
the course of a single night.&nbsp; Apparently they are all well
supported, and are all doing well.&nbsp; If you see a theatre
well filled, that is no criterion of success.&nbsp; It may be,
for aught you know, well filled with paper, but the music-hall is
a paying audience, and it is cash, not paper, that is placed in
the proprietor&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; In the east of London I find
that both as regards the theatres and music-halls the proprietors
have a dodge by means of which they considerably increase their
profits, and that is to open a particular entrance a little
before the time for admission, and to allow people to <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>enter on
payment of a small extra fee.&nbsp; It was thus the other night I
made my way into a music-hall.&nbsp; I paid an extra twopence
rather than stand waiting half an hour outside in the
crowd.&nbsp; Another thing I also learned the other night that
must somewhat detract from the reputation of the theatre,
considered in a temperance point of view, and that is the
drinking customs are not so entirely banished as at first sight
we may suppose.&nbsp; The thousands who fill up the Vic., and the
Pavilion in Whitechapel, perhaps do not drink quite as much as
they would had they spent the evening at a music-hall, but they
do drink, nevertheless, and generally are provided with a bottle
of liquor which they carry with them, with other refreshment,
down into the pit, or up where the gods live and lie
reclined.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to reckon the number of music-halls in
London, it is equally impossible <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to denote the public-houses with
musical performances.&nbsp; In Whitechapel the other night I
discovered two free-and-easies on my way to one of the
music-halls of that district.&nbsp; They were, in reality,
music-halls of a less pretentious character, and yet they
advertised outside the grand attractions of a star company
within.&nbsp; Prospects may be cloudy, trade may be bad, and, as
a slang writer remarks, things all round may be unpromising, but
the business of the music-hall fluctuates very little.&nbsp;
Enter at any time between nine and ten and you have little chance
of a seat, and none whatever of a good place.&nbsp; As to numbers
it is difficult to give an idea.&nbsp; Some of the officials are
wisely chary in this matter, and equally so on the subject of
profits.&nbsp; The Foresters&rsquo; Hall in Cambridge Heath Road
advertises itself to hold four thousand people, and that does not
by any means strike me as one of the largest of the <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>music-halls.&nbsp; Last year the entire British public
spent &pound;140,000,000, or eight shillings a week for each
family, in drink, and the music-halls help off the drink in an
astonishing way.&nbsp; As I went into a music-hall last autumn I
saw a receipt for &pound;51 as the profit for an entertainment
given there on behalf of the Princess Alice Fund, and if the
attendance was a little greater, and the profit a little larger
than usual, still a fair deduction from &pound;51 for bad nights
and slack times will make a pretty handsome total at the end of
the year after all.&nbsp; Now and then the music-hall does a
little bit of philanthropy in another way, which is sure to be
made the most of in the papers.&nbsp; For instance, last year Mr.
Fort, of the Foresters&rsquo; Music Hall, invited some of the
paupers from a neighbouring workhouse to spend the evening with
him.&nbsp; I daresay he had a good many old customers <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>among the
lot, whereupon someone writes in <i>Fun</i> as follows:
&ldquo;The Bethnal Green Guardians showed themselves superior to
the Bath Guardians the other day, and in response to the offer of
Mr. Fort, proprietor of the Foresters&rsquo; Music-hall,
rescinded the resolution prohibiting the paupers from partaking
of any amusement other than that afforded within the workhouse
walls.&nbsp; So the inmates of the union had a day out, and, we
trust, forgot for awhile their sorrows and troubles.&nbsp; It is
whispered that, in addition to pleasing the eye and the ear, the
promoter of the entertainment presented each of his visitors with
a little drop of something of an equally Fort-ified
character.&rdquo;&nbsp; I may add that the Foresters&rsquo;
Music-hall claims to be a celebrated popular family resort, and
that evening I was there the performance was one to which a
family might be invited.&nbsp; Of course the family must have a
turn for drink.&nbsp; They cannot <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>go there without drinking.&nbsp;
There is the public-house entrance to suggest drink, the bar at
the end of the saloon to encourage it, and the waiters are there
expressly to hand it round, and a good-natured man of course does
not like to see waiters standing idle, and accordingly gives his
orders; and besides, it is an axiom in political economy that the
supply creates the demand.</p>
<p>Here are some of the verses I have heard sung with immense
applause:</p>
<blockquote><p>The spiritualists only can work by night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They keep it
dark;<br />
For their full-bodied spirits cannot stand the light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they keep it
dark;<br />
They profess to call <i>spirits</i>, but I call for <i>rum</i><br
/>
And <i>brandy</i> or <i>gin</i> as the best medi<i>um</i><br />
For raising the spirits whenever I&rsquo;m glum;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But keep it
dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The utter silliness of many of the songs is shown by the
following, &ldquo;sung with <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>immense success,&rdquo; as I read in
the programme, by Herbert Campbell:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve read of little Jack Horner,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve read of Jack and Jill,<br />
And old Mother Hubbard,<br />
Who went to the cupboard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give her poor dog a pill;<br />
But the best is Cowardy Custard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who came to awful grief<br />
Through eating a plate of mustard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any plate of beef.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Chorus</i>.</p>
<p>Cowardy Cowardy Custard, oh dear me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swallowed his father&rsquo;s mustard, oh dear
me&mdash;<br />
He swallowed the pot, and he collared it hot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, much to his disgust,<br />
The mustard swelled, Cowardy yelled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Cowardy Cowardy bust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is supposed, I presume, to be a good song.&nbsp; What are
we to think of the people who call it so?&nbsp; It is difficult
to imagine the depth of imbecility thus reached on the part of
singer and hearers, and is a fine illustration of the influence
of beer and &ldquo;baccy&rdquo; as regards softening the
brain.&nbsp; <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>The music-hall singer degrades his audience.&nbsp; Even
when he sings of passing events he panders as much as possible to
the passions and prejudices of the mob.&nbsp; His words are
redolent of claptrap and fury, and are a mischievous element in
the formation of public opinion.&nbsp; Heroes and patriots are
not made in music-halls.&nbsp; But rogues and drunkards and
vagabonds&mdash;and lazy, listless lives, destitute of all moral
aim.&nbsp; There are respectable people who go to
music-halls&mdash;women as well as men&mdash;but they get little
good there.&nbsp; Indeed, it would be a miracle if they did.</p>
<p>But the great fact is that the music-hall makes young men
indulge in expensive habits&mdash;get into bad company, and
commence a career which ends in the jail.&nbsp; Amusement has not
necessarily a bad effect, or else it would be a poor look-out for
all.&nbsp; It is as much our duty to be merry as it is to be
wise.&nbsp; It is the drinking at these <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>places that
does the mischief.&nbsp; It is that that leads to a low tone of
entertainment, and deadens the conscience of the young man who
thinks he is enjoying life, and makes the working man forget how
the money he squanders away would make his home brighter, and his
wife and children happier, and would form a nice fund to be drawn
on when necessary on a rainy day.&nbsp; The great curse of the
age is extravagant and luxurious living, always accompanied with
a low tone of public intelligence and morality and thought.&nbsp;
In the present state of society we see that realised in the men
and women who crowd our music-halls, and revel in the songs the
most improper, and in the dances the most indelicate.</p>
<p>As I write, another illustration of the pernicious influence
of music-halls appears in the newspapers.&nbsp; At the Middlesex
Sessions, John B. Clarke surrendered to <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>his bail on
an indictment charging him with attempting to wound his wife, and
with having wounded George Marshall, police constable, in the
execution of his duty.&nbsp; When Marshall was on duty in Jubilee
Street on the night of November 28th, he heard loud cries of
&ldquo;Murder&rdquo; and &lsquo;&ldquo;Police,&rdquo; and went to
the prisoner&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He found the prisoner and his
wife struggling in the passage, and the wife, seeing him, cried
out, &ldquo;Policeman, he has a knife and has threatened to cut
my throat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The police-constable closed with the
prisoner and endeavoured to wrest the knife from him, when the
prisoner made two stabs at his wife which fortunately missed her,
and another stab which cut the hand of Marshall, who succeeded in
wresting the knife from the prisoner, and took him to the
station.&nbsp; In cross-examination it was elicited that
prisoner&rsquo;s wife had gone to a music-hall; that her <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>husband,
returning home, found her with two or three young men and women
sitting together in his parlour; that one of the young men kissed
her, and that the prisoner, seeing this, became mad with
jealousy, and seized the first thing that came to his hand.&nbsp;
A gentleman, in whose employment the prisoner was, gave him an
exceptionally high character for more than eighteen years, and
expressed his perfect willingness to have him back into his
service and to become security for his good behaviour.&nbsp; The
jury convicted the prisoner of causing actual bodily harm,
strongly recommending him to mercy, and expressing their belief
that he had no intention to wound the policeman.&nbsp; Mr.
Prentice said this was a peculiarly sad and painful case.&nbsp;
To wound or even obstruct a policeman in the execution of his
duty was a serious offence; but looking at all the circumstances
of the case, the finding of the <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>jury, and their recommendation to
mercy, he sentenced him to one month&rsquo;s hard labour, and
accepted his employer&rsquo;s surety that he would keep the peace
for the next three months.&nbsp; The grand jury commended
Marshall for his conduct in the case.</p>
<p>Another thing also may be said.&nbsp; The other evening I was
dining with a lawyer with a large police practice, in what may be
called, and what really is, a suburb of London.&nbsp; My friend
is what may be described as a man of the world, and of course is
anything but a fanatic in the cause of temperance.&nbsp; I spoke
of a music-hall in his immediate neighbourhood, and said I
intended dropping in after dinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;the worst of the place is that if we ever have a
case of embezzlement on the part of some shop-boy or porter, it
is always to be traced to that music-hall.&nbsp; A lad goes
there, is led into expenses <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>beyond his means, thinks it manly to
drink and to treat flash women, and one fine morning it is
discovered that he has been robbing the till, and is ruined for
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words of an experienced observer, I conclude.</p>
<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>V.&mdash;SUNDAYS WITH THE PEOPLE.</h2>
<p>It is said&mdash;and indeed it has been said so often that I
feel ashamed of saying it&mdash;that one half the world does not
know how the other half lives.&nbsp; I am sure that whether that
is true or not, few of my City readers have any idea of what goes
on in the City while they are sitting comfortably at home, or are
sitting equally comfortably at church or chapel (for of course
the denunciations of the preacher when he speaks of the depravity
of the age do not refer to them).&nbsp; Suppose we take a stroll
in the eastern part of the City, where the dirt is greatest, the
population <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>most intense, and the poverty most dire.&nbsp; We need
not rise very early.&nbsp; On a Sunday morning we are all of us a
little later at breakfast than on ordinary occasions.&nbsp; We
sit longer over our welcome meal&mdash;our toilette is a little
more elaborate&mdash;so that we are in the City this particular
Sunday about half-past nine&mdash;a later hour than most of the
City-men patronise on the week-day.&nbsp; In the leading
thoroughfares shops are shut and there are few people about, and
in the City, especially these dark winter mornings, when the
golden gleam of sunshine gilds the raw and heavy fog which in the
City heralds the approach of day, very few signs of life are
visible, very few omnibuses are to be seen, and even the cabs
don&rsquo;t seem to care whether you require their services or
whether you let them alone.&nbsp; Here and there a brisk young
man or a spruce maiden may be seen hastening to teach at some
Sunday school; <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>otherwise respectability is either asleep or away.</p>
<p>As we pass along, the first thing that strikes the stranger is
a dense unsavoury mob to be met outside certain buildings.&nbsp;
We shall see one such assemblage in Bell Alley, Goswell Street;
we shall see another in Artillery Street; there will be another
at the Cow Cross Mission Hall, and another in Whitecross Street,
and another in a wretched little hovel, you can scarcely call it
a building, in Thaull Street.&nbsp; Just outside the City, at the
Memorial Hall, Bethnal Green, and at the Rev. W. Tyler&rsquo;s
Ragged Church in King Edward Street, there will be similar
crowds.&nbsp; Let us look at them.&nbsp; It is not well to go too
near, for they are unsavoury even on these cold frosty
mornings.&nbsp; Did you ever see such wretched, helpless, dirty,
ragged, seedy, forlorn men and women in all your life?&nbsp; I
think not.&nbsp; Occasionally on a week-day we see a <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>beggar,
shirtless and unwashed and unkempt, shivering in the street, but
here in these mobs we see nothing else.&nbsp; They have tickets
for free breakfasts provided for them under the care of Mr. J. J.
Jones and the Homerton Mission.&nbsp; How they crowd around the
doors, waiting for admission; how sad and disconsolate those who
have not tickets look as they turn away!&nbsp; What a feast of
fat things, you say, there must be inside.&nbsp; My dear sir, it
is nothing of the kind.&nbsp; All that is provided for them is a
small loaf of bread, with the smallest modicum of butter, and a
pint of cocoa.&nbsp; Not much of a breakfast that to you or me,
who have two or three good meals a day, but a veritable godsend
to the half-starved and wretched souls we see outside.&nbsp; Let
us follow them inside.&nbsp; The tables and the long forms on
which they are seated are of the rudest kind.&nbsp; The room, as
a rule, is anything but attractive, nor is the atmosphere <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>very
refreshing.&nbsp; A City missionary or an agent of the Christian
community, or a devoted Christian woman or a young man, whose
heart is in the work&mdash;is distributing the materials of the
feast, which are greedily seized and ravenously devoured.&nbsp;
Let us look at them now they have taken their hats off.&nbsp;
What uncombed heads; what dirty faces; what scant and threadbare
garments!&nbsp; There are women too, and they seem to have fallen
lower than the men.&nbsp; They look as if they had not been to
bed for months; as if all pride of personal appearance had long
since vanished; as if they had come out of a pigstye.</p>
<p>Well, the world is a hard one for such as they, and no one can
grudge them the cheap meal which Christian charity
provides.&nbsp; It seems a mockery to offer these waifs and
strays of the streets and alleys and disreputable slums of the
City a Gospel address till something has been done to <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>assuage the
pangs of hunger, and to arouse in them the dormant and better
feelings of their nature.&nbsp; It is thus these mission-halls
are enabled to do a little good, to go down to the very depths,
as it were, in the endeavour to reform a wasted life, and to save
a human soul.&nbsp; As you look at these men and women you
shudder.&nbsp; Most of them are in what may be called the prime
of life; able-bodied, ripe for mischief, fearing not God,
regarding not man.&nbsp; It must do them good to get them
together at these Sunday morning breakfasts, where they may
realise that Christian love which makes men and women in the
middle and upper classes of society have compassion on such as
they.</p>
<p>Getting out into the open air, or rather into the open street,
I heard a band of singers advance.&nbsp; It is a procession, but
not a very dangerous one.&nbsp; The leader walks with his back to
us, an act rarely exercised out of royal circles.&nbsp; It is
thus <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>he
guides the vocalists before him, who go walking arm-in-arm
singing with all their might; while at the rear a
pleasant-looking man follows, giving papers to the people.&nbsp;
I take one, and learn that this is Mr. Booth&rsquo;s Allelujah
Band, and that a seat is kindly offered me in his tabernacle,
where I can hear the Gospel.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t accept the
invitation; I can hear the Gospel without going to Whitechapel,
and Mr. Booth&rsquo;s extravagances are not to my taste.&nbsp;
Apparently this Sunday morning the people do not respond to the
invitation.&nbsp; It is evident that in this part of the City the
novelty of the thing has worn off.</p>
<p>I scarce know whether I am in the City or not.&nbsp; I plunge
into a mass of streets and courts leading from Artillery Street
to King Edward Street at one end, and Bethnal Green at the
other.&nbsp; Here is a market in which a brisk provision trade is
carried on, and men and women are purchasing <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>all the
materials of a Sunday dinner.&nbsp; Outside Rag-fair a trade
similar to that which prevails there seems also to be carried
on.&nbsp; I see no policemen about, and the people apparently do
just as they like; and the filth and garbage left lingering in
some of the narrow streets are anything but pleasant.&nbsp; As a
I rule, I observe the policemen only patronise the leading
thoroughfares, and then it seems to me they act in a somewhat
arbitrary manner.&nbsp; For instance, opposite the Broad Street
Terminus a lad is cleaning a working man&rsquo;s boots.&nbsp;
While he is in the middle of the operation the policeman comes
and compels him to march off.&nbsp; I move on a dozen steps, and
there, up Broad Street&mdash;just as you enter the Bishopsgate
Station of the Metropolitan Railway&mdash;is another lad engaged
in the same work of shoe or boot cleaning.&nbsp; Him the
policeman leaves alone.&nbsp; I wonder why.&nbsp; Justice is
painted <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>blind, and perhaps the policeman is occasionally
ditto.&nbsp; In Bishopsgate Street itself the crowd was large of
idle boys and men, who seemed to have nothing particular to do,
and did not appear to care much about doing that.&nbsp; They took
no note of the Sabbath bells which called them to worship.&nbsp;
To them the Sunday morning was simply a waste of time.&nbsp; They
had turned out of their homes and lodgings, and were simply
walking up and down the street till it was time to open the
public-house.&nbsp; In that street, as the reader may be aware,
there is the Great Central Hall, and as its doors were open, I
went in.&nbsp; The audience was very scanty, and apparently
temperance does not find more favour with the British working man
than the Gospel.&nbsp; Mr. Ling was in the chair.&nbsp; There was
now and then a hymn sung or a temperance melody, and now and then
a speech.&nbsp; Indeed, the speeches <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>were almost as numerous as the
hearers.&nbsp; It seems the society keeps a missionary at work in
that part of the City, and he had much to say of the cases of
reformation going on under his care.&nbsp; The best speech I
heard was that of a working builder, who said for years he had
been in the habit of spending eight shillings a week in the
drink, and how much better off he was now that he kept the money
in his pocket.&nbsp; I wished the man had more of his class to
hear him.&nbsp; Of course he rambled a little and finished off
with an attack on the bishops, which the chairman (Mr. Ling) very
properly did not allow to pass unchallenged, as he quoted Bishop
Temple as a teetotaler, and referred to the hearty way in which
many of the clergy of the Church of England supported the
temperance cause.</p>
<p>I hasten to other scenes.&nbsp; I next find myself in Sclater
Street, and here up and down surges a black mob, sufficient at
any <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>rate, were it so disposed, to fill St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral.&nbsp; This mob is composed entirely of working
men&mdash;men who are amused with anything, and hurry in swarms
to a hatter&rsquo;s shop, who simply throws out among them pink
and yellow cards, indicating the extraordinary excellence and
unparalleled cheapness of the wares to be sold within.</p>
<p>Foreigners say Sunday is a dull day; that then there is no
business doing in London; and that everyone is very sad on that
day.&nbsp; In Sclater Street they would soon find out their
mistake.&nbsp; There, it is evident, little of Sunday quiet and
Sunday dulness exists.&nbsp; On each side of me are shops with
birds; and if there is not a brisk trade going on, it is
certainly not the fault of the tradesmen.&nbsp; We have just had
what the bird-catchers call the November flight of linnets, and
in Sclater Street the market overflows with them.&nbsp; The
London <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>and suburban bird-catchers, who are not to be put down
by Act of Parliament, have had a fine time of it this year.&nbsp;
The principal part of the linnets are bred on the wild gorse
lands, and it is the wild weather such as we have had of late
that drives them into the nets of the suburban fowler, who this
year has been so lucky as to take five dozen of them at one pull
of the clap-net.&nbsp; Goldfinches also are abundant, in
consequence of the provision of the Wild Birds Preservation
Act.&nbsp; On Sunday a bird-dealer offers me them at threepence
each, or four for a shilling.&nbsp; It is sad to see the poor
little things shut up in their bits of cages in the dirty shops
of Sclater Street.&nbsp; The proprietor with his unwashed hands
takes them out one by one and holds them out in vain.&nbsp; The
British workman crowds round and admires, but he does not buy, as
he is keeping his money in his pocket till 1 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the &ldquo;public&rdquo; opens its
congenial doors, and his unnatural thirst is slaked.&nbsp; It is
really shocking, this display of these beautiful little
songsters.&nbsp; What crime have they committed that they should
be imprisoned in the dirt and bad air and uncongenial fog of
Sclater Street?&nbsp; What are the uses of the Wild Birds
Preservation Act if the only result is the crowding the shops of
the bird-dealers in Sclater Street?&nbsp; I felt indeed indignant
at the sight thus permitted, and at the trade thus carried
on.&nbsp; Cocks and hens, ducks and rabbits, are proper subjects
of sale, I admit, though I see no particular reason why, when
other shops are closed, shops for the sale of them are permitted
to remain open; but blackbirds, linnets, thrushes, goldfinches,
bullfinches&mdash;the ornaments of the country, the cheerful
choristers of the garden and the grove&mdash;deserve kinder
treatment at our hands, even if the result be that Sclater <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Street does
less business and is less of an attractive lounge to the British
operative on a Sabbath morn.&nbsp; Away from Sclater Street and
Bishopsgate Street the crowd thins, and the ordinary lifeless
appearance of the Sunday in London is visible everywhere.&nbsp;
Here and there a gray-headed old gentleman or an elderly female
may be seen peeping out of a first-floor window into the sad and
solitary street, but the younger branches of the family are
away.&nbsp; Now and then you catch a crowd of workmen who are
much given to patronise the showy van which the proprietor of
some invaluable preparation of sarsaparilla utilises for the sale
of his specific for purifying the blood and keeping off all the
ills to which flesh is heir.&nbsp; Such shops as are open for the
sale of cheap confectionery I see also are well patronised, and
in some quarters evidently an attempt made to dispose of
ginger-beer.&nbsp; On the cold frosty <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>morning the hot-chestnut trade
appears also to be in demand, though I question whether all who
crowd round the vendors of such articles are
<i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> buyers; rather, it seems to me, that under
the pretence of being such they are taking a mean advantage of
the little particle of warmth thrown out by the charcoal fire
used for the purpose of roasting chestnuts.&nbsp; Well, I
can&rsquo;t blame them; it is cold work dawdling in the streets,
and if I were a British workman I fancy I should find a little
more interest in church than in the idle walk and talk of some,
or in the habit others have of standing stock still till The Pig
and Whistle or the Blue Lion open their doors.&nbsp; It is well
to be free and independent and your own master, but that is no
reason why all the Sunday morning should be spent in loafing
about the streets.</p>
<p>But what about the many?&nbsp; Well, the <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>public-houses are open, and it is there the British
workman feels himself but too much at home.&nbsp; And then there
is the Hall of Science, in Old Street, which is generally crowded
by an audience who pay gladly for admission to hear Mr.
Bradlaugh, who is a very able man, lecture, in a style which
would shock many good people if they were to hear him.&nbsp; I
must candidly admit that in that style he is far outdone by Mrs.
Besant, who takes the Bible to pieces, and turns it inside out,
and holds up to ridicule all its heroes and prophets, and kings
and apostles, and Christ himself, with a zest which seems
perfectly astonishing when we remember how much Christianity has
done for the elevation of the people in general and woman in
particular.&nbsp; Mrs. Besant is a very clever woman, and she
means well I daresay, still it is not pleasant to see the Hall of
Science so well filled as it is on a Sunday night.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>The
Hall of Science in the Old Street Road is not an attractive place
outside, and internally it is less of a hall and more of a barn
than any public building with which I chance to be
familiar.&nbsp; And yet, Sunday night after Sunday night, it is
well filled, though the admission for each person is from
threepence to a shilling, and there is no attempt by music or
ritual to attract the sentimental or the weak.&nbsp; The lectures
delivered are long and argumentative, and it is worth the study,
especially of the Christian minister who complains that he cannot
get at the working man, how it is that the people prefer to pay
money to hear the lectures at Old Street, while he offers them
the Gospel without money and without price and often with the
additional attraction of a free tea.&nbsp; With that view I went
to hear Mrs. Besant one Sunday night.&nbsp; I know little of Mrs.
Besant, save that she has been made the <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>subject of
a prosecution which, whatever be its results, whether of fine or
imprisonment to herself or of gain to her prosecutors, is one
deeply to be deplored.&nbsp; If a clergyman of the Established
Church of England established or attempted to establish the fact
that mankind has a tendency to increase beyond the means of
existence, a woman, on behalf of the sex that has the most to
suffer from the misery of overpopulation, has a right in the
interests of humanity to call attention to the subject.&nbsp; In
a very old-fashioned couplet it has been remarked of
woman&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That if she will, she will, you may depend
on&rsquo;t;<br />
And if she won&rsquo;t, she won&rsquo;t, and there&rsquo;s an end

<p>To that class of female Mrs. Besant emphatically
belongs.&nbsp; She is one of those rare ones who will say what
she thinks.&nbsp; There is a great deal of firmness in her
face.&nbsp; Such a woman always goes her own way.&nbsp; It was a
pleasant change from the strong <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>meat of the Hall of
Science&mdash;the withering scorn and contempt there poured on
all that the best men in the world have held to be best&mdash;to
the mild excitement of a Shakespearian reading in a
public-house.&nbsp; Could there be a fitter teacher for the
people who do not go to church, and, let me add, also for those
who do?&nbsp; There could be no negative reply to such a
question, and surely if Shakespeare is quoted in the pulpit on a
Sunday morning, the people may hear him read on a Sunday
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday evening readings for the people!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Only think of that!&nbsp; What a gain from the tap-room and the
bar-parlour.&nbsp; Such was the announcement that met my eye the
other night in a street not a hundred miles from King&rsquo;s
Cross railway station.&nbsp; Mr. So-and-So, the bill proceeded to
state, had the pleasure to inform his friends that, with a view
to <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>oblige the public, he had secured the services of a
celebrated dramatic reader, who would on every Sunday evening
read or recite passages from Shakespeare, Thackeray, Dickens,
Hood, Thornbury, Sketchley, etc.&nbsp; Further, the bill stated
that these readings would commence at a quarter-past seven, and
terminate at a quarter-past ten.&nbsp; Could I resist such an
intellectual treat?&nbsp; Could I deny myself such an exquisite
gratification?&nbsp; Forgive me, indulgent reader, if for once I
made up my mind I could not.&nbsp; The difficulty was where to
find the place, for, in my delight at finding a publican so
public-spirited&mdash;so ready to compete with the attractions of
St. George&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;I had unfortunately failed to make
a note of the house thus kindly thrown open to an intelligent
public.&nbsp; The difficulty was greater than would at first
sight appear, for on Sunday night shops are mostly closed, and
there are few people in a position to answer <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>anxious
inquirers.&nbsp; Great gin-palaces were flaring away in all their
glory, and doing a roaring trade at the time when church-bells
were ringing for evening service, and decent people were
hastening to enter the sanctuary, and for awhile to forget earth
with its care and sin.&nbsp; In vain I timidly entered and put
the query to the customers at the crowded bar, to potman over the
counter, to landlord, exceptionally brilliant in the splendour of
his Sunday clothes.&nbsp; They knew nothing of the benevolent
individual whose whereabouts I sought; and evidently had a poor
opinion of me for seeking his address.&nbsp; Sunday evening
readings for the people! what cared they for them?&nbsp; Why
could I not stand soaking like the others at their bar, and not
trouble my head about readings from Shakespeare and
Dickens?&nbsp; Such evidently was the train of thought suggested
by my questions.&nbsp; Just over the way was a
police-station.&nbsp; Of <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>course the police would know; it was
their duty to know what went on in all the public-houses of the
district.&nbsp; I entered, and found three policemen in the
charge of a superior officer.&nbsp; I put my question to him, and
then to them all.&nbsp; Alas! they knew as little of the matter
as myself; indeed, they knew less, for they had never heard of
such a place, and seemed almost inclined to &ldquo;run me
in&rdquo; for venturing to suppose they had.&nbsp; What wonderful
fellows are our police!&nbsp; I say so because all our
penny-a-liners say so; but my opinion is, after all, that they
can see round a corner or through a brick wall just as well as
myself or any other man, and no more.&nbsp; Clearly this was a
case in point, for the public-house I was seeking was hardly a
stone&rsquo;s-throw off, and I was directed to it by an
intelligent greengrocer, who was standing at his shop-door and
improving his mind by the study of that fearless champion of the
wrongs of the <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>oppressed and trodden-down British working man,
<i>Lloyd&rsquo;s Weekly Newspaper</i>.&nbsp; It was he who put me
on the right scent&mdash;not that he was exactly
certain&mdash;but he indicated the house at which such
proceedings were likely to take place, and as he was right in his
conjecture, I take this opportunity of publicly returning him my
thanks.&nbsp; Had it not been for him I should have had no
Shakespeare, no Thackeray, no Hood, no Dickens, no feast of
reason and flow of soul that Sunday night.&nbsp; As it was, it
turned out as I expected, and I had very little of either to
reward my painful search.&nbsp; As I have said, the nominal hour
at which proceedings commenced was a quarter-past seven; in
reality, it was not till nearly half-past eight that the
celebrated dramatic reader favoured us with a specimen of his
powers.&nbsp; It was true he was in the house, but he was down in
the bar with a select circle, indulging in the luxuries generally
to be found in such <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>places.&nbsp; In the meantime I took
stock leisurely of the room upstairs in which we assembled, and
of its occupants.&nbsp; At that early hour the latter were not
numerous.&nbsp; A little foreigner with his wife was seated by
the fire, and him she led off before the dramatic readings
commenced.&nbsp; Reasons, which a sense of delicacy forbids my
mentioning, suggested the wisdom and the prudence of an early
retirement from a scene rather dull&mdash;at any rate, quite the
reverse of gay and festive.&nbsp; As to the rest of us, I
can&rsquo;t say that we were a particularly lively lot.&nbsp; A
stern regard to truth compels me reluctantly to remark that we
were unprepossessing looking rather than otherwise.&nbsp; The
majority I of us there were lads with billycock hats and short
pipes, who talked little to each other, but smoked and drank beer
in solemn silence.&nbsp; The cheerfulest personage in the room
was the potboy, who, as he stalked about with his apron on and <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>his
shirt-sleeves tucked up, seemed to be quite at home with his
customers.&nbsp; Some of the lads had their sweethearts with
them; at any rate I presume they were such from the retiring way
in which they sat&mdash;she, after the manner of such young
people in a large room, chiefly occupied in counting the ten
fingers of her red and ungloved hands, while her male admirer sat
smoking his short pipe and spitting on the sanded floor in a way
more suggestive of perfect freedom than of grace.&nbsp; I could
see but two decent-looking girls in the room, which, by the time
the entertainment was over, contained as many as sixty or
seventy.&nbsp; Evidently the class of customers expected was a
low one, greengrocers&rsquo; and costermongers&rsquo; boys
apparently, and such like.&nbsp; The tables were of the commonest
order, and we had no chairs, nothing but long forms, to sit
on.&nbsp; In the middle by the wall was a small platform,
carpeted; on this platform was a chair and <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>table, and
it was there the hero of the evening seated himself, and it was
from thence that at intervals he declaimed.&nbsp; As to the
entertainment, if such it may be called, the less said about it
the better.&nbsp; A more fifth-rate, broken-down, ranting old
hack I think I never heard.&nbsp; Even now it puzzles me to think
how the landlord could have ever had the impudence to attach the
term &ldquo;celebrated&rdquo; to his name.&nbsp; It seemed as if
the reader had an impediment in his speech, so laughable and
grotesque was his enunciation, which, however, never failed to
bring down an applause in the way of raps on the tables which
caused the glasses to jingle&mdash;to the manifest danger of
spilling their contents.&nbsp; We had a recitation about Robert
Bruce, and other well-known readings; then he bellowed and tossed
his arms about and screamed!&nbsp; How dull were his comic
passages!&nbsp; How comic was his pathos!&nbsp; Surely never was
good poetry <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>more mangled in its delivery before.&nbsp; I can stand
a good deal&mdash;I am bound to stand a good deal, for in the
course of a year I have to listen to as much bad oratory as most;
but at last I could stand it no longer, and was compelled to beat
a precipitate retreat, feeling that I had over-estimated the
public spirit of the landlord and his desire to provide
intellectual amusement for his friends&mdash;feeling that these
readings for the people are nothing better than an excuse for
getting boys and girls to sit smoking and drinking, wasting their
time and injuring their constitutions, on a night that should be
sacred to better things, in the tainted atmosphere of a
public-house.</p>
<h2><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>VI.&mdash;THE LOW LODGING-HOUSE.</h2>
<p>Is chiefly to be found in Whitechapel, in Westminster, and in
Drury Lane.&nbsp; It is in such places the majority of our
working men live, especially when they are out of work or given
to drink; and the drinking that goes on in these places is often
truly frightful, especially where the sexes are mixed, and
married people, or men and women supposed to be such,
abound.&nbsp; In some of these lodging-houses as many as two or
three hundred people live; and if anything can keep a man down in
the world, and render him hopeless as to the future, it is the
society and the general <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>tone of such places.&nbsp; Yet in
them are to be met women who were expected to shine in
society&mdash;students from the universities&mdash;ministers of
the Gospel&mdash;all herding in these filthy dens like so many
swine.&nbsp; It is rarely a man rises from the low surroundings
of a low lodging-house.&nbsp; He must be a very strong man if he
does.&nbsp; Such a place as a Workman&rsquo;s City has no charms
for the class of whom I write.&nbsp; Some of them would not care
to live there.&nbsp; It is no attraction to them that there is no
public-house on the estate, that the houses are clean, that the
people are orderly, that the air is pure and bracing.&nbsp; They
have no taste or capacity for the enjoyment of that kind of
life.&nbsp; They have lived in slums, they have been accustomed
to filth, they have no objection to overcrowding, they must have
a public-house next door.&nbsp; This is why they live in St.
Giles&rsquo;s or in Whitechapel, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>where the sight of their numbers is
appalling, or why they crowd into such low neighbourhoods as
abound in Drury Lane.&nbsp; Drury Lane is not at all times handy
for their work.&nbsp; On the contrary, some of its inhabitants
come a long way.&nbsp; One Saturday night I met a man there who
told me he worked at Aldershot.&nbsp; Of course to many it is
convenient.&nbsp; It is near Covent Garden, where many go to work
as early as 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; and it is close to
the Strand, where its juvenile population earn their daily
food.&nbsp; Ten to one the boy who offers you &ldquo;the Hevening
Hecho,&rdquo; the lass who would fain sell you cigar-lights and
flowers, the woman who thrusts the opera programme into your
carriage as you drive down Bow Street, the questionable gentleman
who, if chance occurs, eases you of your pocket-handkerchief or
your purse, the poor girl who, in tawdry finery, walks her weary
way backwards <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>and forwards in the Strand, whether the weather be wet
or dry, long after her virtuous sisters are asleep&mdash;all hail
from Drury Lane.&nbsp; It has ever been a spot to be
shunned.&nbsp; Upwards of a hundred years ago, Gay wrote in his
&ldquo;Trivia&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, may thy virtue guard thee through the roads<br
/>
Of Drury&rsquo;s mazy courts and dark abodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not of Drury Lane itself, but of its mazy courts that I
write.&nbsp; Drury Lane is a shabby but industrious street.&nbsp;
It is inhabited chiefly by tradespeople, who, like all of us,
have to work hard for their living; but at the back of Drury
Lane&mdash;on the left as you come from New Oxford
Street&mdash;there run courts and streets as densely inhabited as
any of the most crowded and filthy parts of the metropolis, and
compared with which Drury Lane is respectability itself.&nbsp; A
few days since I wanted to hear Happy William in a fine new
chapel they <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>have got in Little Wild Street.&nbsp; As I went my way,
past rag-shops and cow-houses, I found myself in an exclusively
Irish population, some of whom were kneeling and crossing
themselves at the old Roman Catholic chapel close by, but the
larger number of whom were drinking at one or other of the
public-houses of the district.&nbsp; At the newspaper-shop at the
corner, the only bills I saw were those of <i>The Flag of
Ireland</i>, or <i>The Irishman</i>, or <i>The
Universe</i>.&nbsp; In about half an hour there were three
fights, one of them between women, which was watched with
breathless interest by a swarming crowd, and which ended in one
of the combatants, a yellow-haired female, being led to the
neighbouring hospital.&nbsp; On his native heather an Irishman
cares little about cleanliness.&nbsp; As I have seen his rude
hut, in which the pigs and potatoes and the children are mixed up
in inextricable confusion, I have felt how pressing is the
question in <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Ireland, not of Home Rule, but of Home Reform.&nbsp; I
admit his children are fat and numerous, but it is because they
live on the hill-side, where no pestilent breath from the city
ever comes.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Drury Lane it is different; there is
no fresh air there, and the only flowers one sees are those
bought at Covent Garden.&nbsp; Everywhere on a summer night (she
&ldquo;has no smile of light&rdquo; in Drury Lane), you are
surrounded by men, women, and children, so that you can scarce
pick your way.&nbsp; In Parker Street and Charles Street, and
such-like places, the houses seem as if they never had been
cleaned since they were built, yet each house is full of
people&mdash;the number of families is according to the number of
rooms.&nbsp; I should say four-and-sixpence a week is the average
rent for these tumble-down and truly repulsive apartments.&nbsp;
Children play in the middle of the street, amidst the dirt and
refuse; costermongers, <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>who are the capitalists of the
district, live here with their donkeys; across the courts is hung
the family linen to dry.&nbsp; You sicken at every step.&nbsp;
Men stand leaning gloomily against the sides of the houses;
women, with unlovely faces, glare at you sullenly as you pass
by.</p>
<p>The City Missionary is, perhaps, the only one who comes here
with a friendly word, and a drop of comfort and hope for
all.&nbsp; Of course the inhabitants are as little indoors as
possible.&nbsp; It may be that the streets are dull and dirty,
but the interiors are worse.&nbsp; Only think of a family, with
grown-up sons and daughters, all living and sleeping in one
room!&nbsp; The conditions of the place are as bad morally as
they are physically.</p>
<p>It is but natural that the people drink more than they eat,
that the women soon grow old and haggard, and that the little
babes, stupefied with gin and beer, die off, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>happily,
almost as fast as they are born.&nbsp; Here you see men and women
so foul and scarred and degraded that it is mockery to say that
they were made in the image of the Maker, and that the
inspiration of the Almighty gave them understanding; and you ask
is this a civilised land, and are we a Christian people?</p>
<p>No wonder that from such haunts the girl gladly rushes to put
on the harlot&rsquo;s livery of shame, and comes here after her
short career of gaiety to die of disease and gin.&nbsp; In some
of the streets are forty or fifty lodging-houses for women or
men, as the case may be.&nbsp; In some of these lodging-houses
there are men who make their thirty shillings or two pounds a
week.&nbsp; In others are the broken-down mendicants who live on
soup-kitchens and begging.&nbsp; You can see no greater
wretchedness in the human form than what you see here.&nbsp; And,
as some of <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>these lodging-houses will hold ninety people, you may
get some idea of their number.&nbsp; When I say that the
sitting-room is common to all, that it has always a roaring fire,
and that all day, and almost all night long, each lodger is
cooking his victuals, you can get a fair idea of the intolerable
atmosphere, in spite of the door being ever open.&nbsp; It seemed
to me that a large number of the people could live in better
apartments if they were so disposed, and if their only enjoyment
was not a public-house debauch.&nbsp; The keepers of these houses
seemed very fair-spoken men.</p>
<p>I met with only one rebuff, and that was at a model house in
Charles Street.&nbsp; As I airily tapped at the window, and asked
the old woman if I could have a bed, at first she was civil
enough, but when I ventured to question her a bit she angrily
took herself off, remarking that she did not know who I was, and
that <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>she
was not going to let a stranger get information out of her.</p>
<p>As to myself, I can only say that I had rather lodge in any
gaol than in the slums of Drury Lane.&nbsp; The sight of sights
in this district is that of the public-houses and the crowds who
fill them.&nbsp; On Saturday every bar was crammed; at some you
could not get in at the door.&nbsp; The women were as numerous as
the men; in the daytime they are far more so; and as almost every
woman has a child in her arms, and another or two tugging at her
gown, and as they are all formed into gossiping knots, one can
imagine the noise of such places.</p>
<p>D.D.&mdash;City readers will know whom I refer to&mdash;has
opened a branch establishment in Drury Lane, and his place was
the only one that was not crowded.&nbsp; I can easily understand
the reason&mdash;one of the regulations of D.D.&rsquo;s
establishment is that no intoxicated person should be
served.&nbsp; I <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>have reason to conclude, from a conversation I had some
time ago with one of D.D.&rsquo;s barmen, that the rule is not
very strictly enforced; but if it were carried out at all by the
other publicans in Drury Lane I am sure there would be a great
falling off of business.&nbsp; Almost every woman had a basket;
in that basket was a bottle, which, in the course of the evening,
was filled with gin for private consumption; and it was quite
appalling to see the number of little pale-faced ragged girls who
came with similar bottles on a similar errand.&nbsp; When the
liquor takes effect, the women are the most troublesome, and use
the worst language.</p>
<p>On my remarking to a policeman that the neighbourhood was,
comparatively speaking, quiet, he said there had been three or
four rows already, and pointed to a pool of blood as confirmation
of his statement.&nbsp; The men seemed all more or less stupidly
drunk, and stood up one against another like <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>a certain
Scotch regiment, of which the officer, when complimented on their
sobriety, remarked that they resembled a pack of cards&mdash;if
one falls, down go all the rest.</p>
<p>Late hours are the fashion in the neighbourhood of Drury
Lane.&nbsp; It is never before two on a Sunday morning that there
is quiet there.&nbsp; Death, says Horace, strikes with equal foot
the home of the poor and the palace of the prince.&nbsp; This is
not true as regards low lodging-houses.&nbsp; Even in Bethnal
Green the Sanitary Commission found that the mean age at death
among the families of the gentry, professionalists, and richer
classes of that part of Loudon was forty-four, whilst that of the
families of the artisan class was about twenty-two.</p>
<p>Everyone&mdash;for surely everyone has read Mr.
Plimsoll&rsquo;s appeal on behalf of the poor sailors&mdash;must
remember the description of his experiences in a lodging-house of
the better sort, established by the efforts of <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Lord
Shaftesbury in Fetter Lane and Hatton Garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
astonishing,&rdquo; says Mr. Plimsoll, &ldquo;how little you can
live on when you divest yourselves of all fancied needs.&nbsp; I
had plenty of good wheat bread to eat all the week, and the half
of a herring for a relish (less will do, if you can&rsquo;t
afford half, for it is a splendid fish), and good coffee to
drink, and I know how much&mdash;or, rather how
little&mdash;roast shoulder of mutton you can get for twopence
for your Sunday&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I propose to write of other lodging-houses&mdash;houses of a
lower character, and filled, I imagine, with men of a lower
class.&nbsp; Mr. Plimsoll speaks in tones of admiration of the
honest hard-working men whom he met in his lodging-house.&nbsp;
They were certainly gifted with manly virtues, and deserved all
his praise.&nbsp; In answer to the question, What did I see
there? he replies:</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;I found the workmen considerate for each
other.&nbsp; I found that they would go out (those who were out
of employment) day after day, and patiently trudge miles and
miles seeking employment, returning night after night
unsuccessful and dispirited, only, however, to sally out the
following morning with renewed determination.&nbsp; They would
walk incredibly long distances to places where they heard of a
job of work; and this, not for a few days, but for many, many
days.&nbsp; And I have seen such a man sit down wearily by the
fire (we had a common room for sitting, and cooking, and
everything), with a hungry, despondent look&mdash;he had not
tasted food all day&mdash;and accosted by another, scarcely less
poor than himself, with &lsquo;Here, mate, get this into
thee,&rsquo; handing him at the same time a piece of bread and
some cold meat, and afterwards some coffee, and adding,
&lsquo;Better luck to-morrow; keep up your pecker.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>And all
this without any idea that they were practising the most splendid
patience, fortitude, courage, and generosity I had ever
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the eulogy is a little overstrained.&nbsp; Men, even
if they are not working men, do learn to help each other, unless
they are very bad indeed; and it does not seem so surprising to
me as it does to Mr. Plimsoll that even such men &ldquo;talk of
absent wife and children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly it is the least
a husband and the father of a family can do.</p>
<p>The British working man has his fair share of faults, but just
now he has been so belaboured on all sides with praise that he is
getting to be rather a nuisance.&nbsp; In our day it is to be
feared he is rapidly degenerating.&nbsp; He does not work so well
as he did, nor so long, and he gets higher wages.&nbsp; One
natural result of this state of things is that the class just
above him&mdash;<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>the class who, perhaps, are the worst off in the
land&mdash;have to pay an increased price for everything that
they eat and drink or wear, or need in any way for the use of
their persons or the comfort and protection of their homes.&nbsp;
Another result, and this is much worse, is that the workman
spends his extra time and wages in the public-houses, and that we
have an increase of paupers to keep and crime to punish.&nbsp;
There is no gainsaying admitted facts; there is no use in
boasting of the increased intelligence of the working man, when
the facts are the other way.&nbsp; As he gets more money and
power, he becomes less amenable to rule and reason.&nbsp; Last
year, according to Colonel Henderson&rsquo;s report, drunk and
disorderly cases had increased from 23,007 to 33,867.&nbsp; It is
to be expected the returns of the City police will be equally
unsatisfactory.&nbsp; As I write, I take the following from
<i>The Echo</i>: In a certain district in London, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>facing each
other, are two corner-houses in which the business of a publican
and a chemist are respectively carried on.&nbsp; In the course of
twenty-five years the houses have changed hands three times, and
at the last change the purchase money of the public-house
amounted to &pound;14,300, and that of the chemist&rsquo;s
business to only &pound;1,000.&nbsp; Of course the publican
drives his carriage and pair, while the druggist has to use
Shanks&rsquo;s pony.</p>
<p>But this is a digression.&nbsp; It is of lodging-houses I
write.&nbsp; It seems that there are lodging-houses of many
kinds.&nbsp; Perhaps some of the best were those of which Mr.
Plimsoll had experience.&nbsp; The Peabody buildings are, I
believe, not inhabited by poor people at all.&nbsp; The worst,
perhaps, are those in Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, and
the adjacent district.&nbsp; One naturally assumes that no good
can come out of Flower and Dean Street, just as it was <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>assumed of
old that no good could come out of Nazareth.&nbsp; This was
illustrated in a curious way the other day.&nbsp; One of the
earnest philanthropists connected with Miss Macpherson&rsquo;s
Home of Industry at the corner, was talking with an old woman on
the way of salvation.&nbsp; She pleaded that on that head she had
nothing to learn.&nbsp; She had led a good life, she had never
done anybody any harm, she never used bad language, and, in
short, she had lived in the village of Morality, to quote John
Bunyan, of which Mr. Worldly Wiseman had so much to say when he
met poor Christian, just as he had escaped with his heavy burden
on his shoulder out of the Slough of Despond, and that would not
do for our young evangelist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; said he sadly, &ldquo;that is not
enough.&nbsp; You may have been all you say, and yet not be a
true Christian after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Of course it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said a man who
had been listening to the conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
never get to heaven that way.&nbsp; You must believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and then you will be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the evangelist, &ldquo;you know that,
do you?&nbsp; I hope you live accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I know it well enough,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;but of course I can&rsquo;t practise it.&nbsp; I am one of
the light-fingered gentry, I am, and I live in Flower and Dean
Street;&rdquo; and away he hurried as if he saw a policeman, and
as if he knew that he was wanted.</p>
<p>The above anecdote, the truth of which I can vouch for,
indicates the sort of place Flower and Dean Street is, and the
kind of company one meets there.&nbsp; It is a place that always
gives the police a great deal of trouble.&nbsp; Close by is a
court, even lower in the world than Flower and Dean <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Street, and
it is to me a wonder how such a place can be suffered to
exist.&nbsp; What with Keane&rsquo;s Court and Flower and Dean
Street the police have their hands pretty full day and night,
especially the latter.&nbsp; Robbery and drunkenness and fighting
and midnight brawls are the regular and normal state of affairs,
and are expected as a matter of course.&nbsp; When I was there
last a woman had been taken out of Keane&rsquo;s Court on a
charge of stabbing a man she had inveigled into one of the
houses, or rather hovels&mdash;you can scarcely call them houses
in the court.&nbsp; She was let off, as the man refused to appear
against her, and the chances are that she will again be at her
little tricks.&nbsp; They have rough ways, the men and women of
this district; they are not given to stand much upon ceremony;
they have little faith in moral suasion, but have unbounded
confidence in physical force.&nbsp; A few miles of such a <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>place, and
London were a Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>But I have not yet described the street.&nbsp; We will walk
down it, if you please.&nbsp; It is not a long street, nor is it
a very new one; but is it a very striking one,
nevertheless.&nbsp; Every house almost you come to is a
lodging-house, and some of them are very large ones, holding as
many as four hundred beds.&nbsp; Men unshaven and unwashed are
standing loafing about, though in reality this is the hour when,
all over London, honest men are too glad to be at work earning
their daily bread.&nbsp; A few lads and men are engaged in the
intellectual and fashionable amusement known as pitch and
toss.&nbsp; Well, if they play fairly, I do not know that City
people can find much fault with them for doing so.&nbsp; They
cannot get rid of their money more quickly than they would were
they to gamble on the Stock Exchange, or to invest in limited <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>liability
companies or mines which promise cent. per cent. and never yield
a rap but to the promoters who get up the bubble, or to the agent
who, as a friend, begs and persuades you to go into them, as he
has a lot of shares which he means to keep for himself, but of
which, as you are a friend, and as a mark of special favour, he
would kindly accommodate you with a few.</p>
<p>But your presence is not welcomed in the street.&nbsp; You are
not a lodger, that is clear.&nbsp; Curious and angry eyes follow
you all the way.&nbsp; Of course your presence there&mdash;the
apparition of anything respectable&mdash;is an event which
creates alarm rather than surprise.</p>
<p>In the square mile of which this street in the centre, it is
computed are crowded one hundred and twenty thousand of our
poorest population&mdash;men and women who have sunk exhausted in
the battle of life, and who come here to hide their wretchedness
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>and
shame, and in too many cases to train their little ones to follow
in their steps.&nbsp; The children have neither shoes nor
stockings.&nbsp; They are covered with filth, they are innocent
of all the social virtues, and here is their happy
hunting-ground; they are a people by themselves.</p>
<p>All round are planted Jews and Germans.&nbsp; In Commercial
Street the chances are you may hear as much German as if you were
in Deutschland itself.&nbsp; Nor is this all; the place is a
perfect Babel.&nbsp; It is a pity that Flower and Dean Street
should be, as it were, representative of England and her
institutions.&nbsp; It must give the intelligent foreigner rather
a shock.</p>
<p>But <i>place aux dames</i> is my motto, and even in the slums
let woman take the position which is her due.&nbsp; In the
streets the ladies are not in any sense particular, and can
scream long and loudly, particularly when under the influence of
liquor.&nbsp; <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>They are especially well developed as to their arms,
and can defend themselves, if that be necessary, against the
rudeness or insolence or the too-gushing affection of the other
sex.&nbsp; As to their manners and morals, perhaps the less said
about them the better.</p>
<p>Let us step into one of the lodging-houses which is set apart
exclusively for their use.&nbsp; The charge for admission is
threepence or fourpence a night, or a little less by the
week.&nbsp; You can have no idea of the size of one of these
places unless you enter.&nbsp; We will pay a visit in the
afternoon, when most of the bedrooms are empty.&nbsp; At the door
is a box-office, as it were, for the sale of tickets of
admission.&nbsp; Behind extends a large room, provided at one end
with cooking apparatus and well supplied with tables and chairs,
at which are seated a few old helpless females, who have nothing
to do, <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>and don&rsquo;t seem to care much about getting out
into the sun.&nbsp; Let us ascend under the guidance of the
female who has charge of the place, and who has to sit up till 3
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to admit her fair friends, some
of whom evidently keep bad hours and are given rather too much to
the habit of what we call making a night of it.&nbsp; Of course
most of the rooms are unoccupied, but they are full of beds,
which are placed as close together as possible; and this is all
the furniture in the room, with the exception of the glass,
without which no one, male or female, can properly perform the
duties of the toilette.&nbsp; One woman is already thus
occupied.&nbsp; In another room, we catch sight of a few still in
bed, or sitting listlessly on their beds.&nbsp; They are mostly
youthful, and regard us from afar with natural
curiosity&mdash;some actually seeming inclined to giggle at our
intrusion.&nbsp; As it is, we feel thankful that we need not <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>remain a
moment in such company, and we leave them to their terrible
fate.</p>
<p>A few hours later they will be out in the streets, seeking
whom they may devour.&nbsp; Go down Whitechapel way, and you will
see them in shoals haunting the public-houses of the district, or
promenading the pavement, or talking to men as sunk in the social
scale as themselves.&nbsp; They are fond of light dresses; they
eschew bonnets or hats.&nbsp; Some are half-starved; others seem
in good condition; and they need be so to stand the life they
have to lead.&nbsp; Let us hope Heaven will have more mercy on
such as they than man.&nbsp; It cannot be that decent respectable
women live in Flower and Dean Street.</p>
<p>But what of the men?&nbsp; Well, I answer at the first glance,
you see that they are a rough lot.&nbsp; Some are simply
unfortunate and friendless and poor; others do really work
honestly for their living&mdash;as dock <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>labourers,
or as porters in some of the surrounding markets, or at any
chance job that may come in their way; many, alas, are of the
light-fingered fraternity.&nbsp; The police have but a poor
opinion of the honesty of the entire district&mdash;but then the
police are so uncharitable!&nbsp; The members of the Christian
community and others who come here on a Sunday and preach in more
than one of the lodging-houses in the street have a better
opinion, and certainly can point to men and women reclaimed by
their labours, and now leading decent godly lives.&nbsp; It
requires some firmness and Christian love to go preaching in
these huge lodging-houses, in which one, it seemed to me, might
easily be made away with.&nbsp; Even in the daytime they have an
ugly look, filled as they are with idle men, who are asleep now,
but who will be busy enough by-and-by&mdash;when honesty has done
its work and respectability is gone to bed.&nbsp; As commercial
speculations <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>I suppose money is made by these places.&nbsp; The
proprietor has but little expense to incur in the way of
providing furniture or attendance, and in some cases he supplies
refreshments, on which of course he makes a profit.&nbsp; But
each lodger is at liberty to cater for himself, or to leave it
alone if times are bad and money is scarce.&nbsp; At any rate
there is the fire always burning, and the locker in which each
lodger may stow away what epicurean delicacy or worldly treasure
he may possess.&nbsp; I have been in prisons and workhouses, and
I can say the inmates of such places are much better lodged, and
have better care taken of them, and are better off than the poor
people of Flower and Dean Street.&nbsp; The best thing that could
happen for them would be the destruction of the whole place by
fire.&nbsp; Circumstances have much to do with the formation of
character, and in a more respectable neighbourhood they <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>would
become a little more respectable themselves.</p>
<p>In the lodging-houses at Westminster the inhabitants are of a
much more industrious character.&nbsp; In Lant Street, Borough,
they are quite the reverse.&nbsp; A man should have his wits
about him who attempts to penetrate into the mysteries or to
understand the life of a low lodging-house there.</p>
<p>For ages the Mint in the Borough has gained an unenviable
name, not only as the happy hunting-ground of the disreputable,
the prostitute, the thief, the outcast, the most wretched and the
lowest of the poor, yet there was a time when it was great and
famous.&nbsp; There that brave and accomplished courtier, the
Duke of Suffolk, brought his royal bride, the handsome sister of
our Henry VIII.&nbsp; It was there poor Edward VI. came on a
visit all the way from Hampton Court.&nbsp; It was the goodly
gift of Mary the unhappy and ill-fated to the <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Archbishop
of York.&nbsp; Somehow or other Church property seems to be
detrimental to the respectability of a neighbourhood, hence the
truth of the old adage, &ldquo;The nearer the church, the farther
from God.&rdquo;&nbsp; At any rate this was the case as regards
the Mint in the Borough, which in Gay&rsquo;s time had sunk so
low that he made it the scene of his &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s
Opera,&rdquo; and there still law may be said to be powerless,
and there still they point out the house in which lived Jonathan
Wild.&nbsp; In the reign of William, our Protestant hero, and
George I., our Hanoverian deliverer, a desperate attempt was made
to clear the place of the rogues and vagabonds to whom it
afforded shelter and sanctuary; but somehow or other in vain,
though all debtors under fifty pounds had their liabilities wiped
off by royal liberality.&nbsp; The place was past mending, and so
it has ever since remained.&nbsp; It is not a neighbourhood for a
lady at any time, but to inhabit it all that is requisite is <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>that, by
fair means or foul (in the Mint they are as little particular as
to the way in which money is made as they are in the City or on
the Stock Exchange), you have fourpence to pay for a
night&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; All round the place prices may be
described as low, to suit the convenience of the customer.&nbsp;
You are shaved for a penny.&nbsp; Your hair is cut and curled for
twopence.&nbsp; The literature for sale may be termed
sensational, and the chandlers&rsquo; shops, which are of the
truest character if I may judge by the contents, do a trade which
may be described as miscellaneous.</p>
<p>It is sad to see the successive waves of pauperism rise and
burst and disappear.&nbsp; On they come, one after another, as
fast as the eye can catch them, and far faster than the mind can
realise all the hidden and complex causes of which they are the
painful result.&nbsp; One asks, Is this always to be so?&nbsp; Is
there to be no end to this supply, of which we see <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>only the
surface, as it were?&nbsp; Are all the lessons of the past in
vain?&nbsp; Cannot Science, with all its boasted arts, remove the
causes, be they what they may, and effect a cure?&nbsp; Is the
task too appalling for philanthropy?&nbsp; Some such thoughts
came into my head as I looked upon the dense mass of men and
women, destitute of work and food, who, at an early hour on the
first Sunday in the New Year were collected from all the
lodging-houses in the unpretentious but well-known building known
as the Gray&rsquo;s Yard Ragged Church and Schools, in a part of
London not supposed, like the Seven Dials, to be the home of the
wretched, and close by the mansions of the rich and the
great.&nbsp; When I entered, as many as seven hundred had been
got together, and there was a crowd three hundred strong, equally
hungry, equally destitute, and equally worthy of Christian
benevolence.&nbsp; On entering, each person, as soon as he or she
had taken his or her seat, <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>was treated to two thick slices of
bread-and-butter and a cup of coffee, and at the close of the
service there was the usual distribution of a pound meat-pie and
a piece of cake to each individual, and coffee <i>ad
libitum</i>.&nbsp; It may be added that the cost of this
breakfast does not come out of the funds of the institution, but
is defrayed by special subscriptions, and that Mr. John Morley
had sent, as he always does, a parcel of one thousand Gospels for
distribution.&nbsp; But what has this got to do, asks the reader,
with the thought which, as I say, the sight suggested to
me?&nbsp; Why, everything.&nbsp; In the course of the morning,
Mr. F. Bevan, the chairman, asked those who had been there before
to hold up their hands, and there was not one hand held up in
answer to the question.&nbsp; There was a similar negative
response when it was asked of that able-bodied mass before
me&mdash;for there were no very old men in the crowd&mdash;as to
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>whether
any of them were in regular work.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s
pauperism is, then, but the crop of the year.&nbsp; Relieved
to-day, next year another crowd will follow; and so the dark and
sullen waves, mournfully moaning and wailing, of the measureless
ocean of human sorrow and suffering, and want and despair, ever
come and ever go.&nbsp; The Christian Church is the lifeboat
sailing across this ocean in answer to the cry for help, and
rescuing them that are ready to perish.&nbsp; There are cynics
who say even all this Christmas feasting does no good.&nbsp; It
is a fact that on Christmas week there is a sudden and wonderful
exodus from the workhouses around London.</p>
<p>We cannot get improved men and women till we have improved
lodging-houses.&nbsp; Recently it was calculated that in St.
Giles&rsquo;s parish (once it was St.
Giles&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields), there were no less than 3,000
families living in single rooms.&nbsp; Again, in <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>the parish
of Holborn, there were quite 12,000, out of a population of
44,000, living in single rooms.&nbsp; Under such circumstances,
what can we expect but physical and moral degradation?&nbsp;
Healthy life is impossible for man or woman, boy or girl.&nbsp; A
Divine Authority tells us, men do not gather grapes of thorns or
figs of thistles.&nbsp; As I write, however, a ray of light
reaches me.&nbsp; It appears nearly 10,000 persons are now
reaping the benefit of the Peabody Fund.&nbsp; In the far east
there are buildings at Shadwell and Spitalfields; in the far west
at Chelsea, in Westminster, and at Grosvenor Road,
Pimlico&mdash;the latter perfectly appointed edifice alone
accommodating 1,952 persons.&nbsp; As many as 768 are lodged in
the Islington block, and on the south side of the Thames there
are Peabody buildings at Bermondsey, in the Blackfriars Road,
Stamford Street, and Southwark Street.&nbsp; One room in the
Peabody buildings is never <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>let to two persons.&nbsp; A writer
in <i>The Daily News</i> says: Advantage has been taken by the
Peabody trustees to purchase land brought into the market by the
operation of the Artisans and Labourers&rsquo; Dwellings
Act.&nbsp; At the present moment nineteen blocks of building are
in course of removal either by the City or the Metropolitan Board
of Works.&nbsp; They are situate at Peartree Court, Clerkenwell;
Goulston Street, Whitechapel; St. George the Martyr, Southwark;
Bedfordbury; Whitechapel and Limehouse, near the London Docks;
High Street, Islington; Essex Road, Islington; Whitecross Street;
Old Pye Street, Westminster; Great Wild Street, Drury Lane;
Marylebone, hard by the Edgware Road; Wells Street, Poplar;
Little Coram Street; and Great Peter Street, Westminster.&nbsp;
All these are under the control of the Metropolitan Board of
Works.&nbsp; The remaining three&mdash;at Petticoat Square, at
Golden Lane, and at Barbican&mdash;<a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>are being removed by the Corporation
of the City of London.&nbsp; It is estimated that forty-one acres
of land will be laid bare by this clearance&mdash;a space capable
of lodging properly at least as many thousand people.&nbsp; There
are of course other helpers in the same direction as the Peabody
trustees, without being quite in the same sense public bodies
administering a large fund for a special purpose, with the single
object of extending its sphere of usefulness in accordance with
public policy.&nbsp; Some of the companies, however, work for
five per cent. return, and their efforts to construct suitable
dwellings for workpeople and labourers are very valuable.&nbsp;
The Improved Industrial Dwellings Company has buildings at
Bethnal Green Road, at Shoreditch, at Willow Street, and close to
the goods station of the Great Northern Railway, besides two
blocks near the City Road.&nbsp; The Metropolitan Association has
blocks of <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>buildings in Whitechapel, and in many spots farther
west, as have the Marylebone Association, the London
Labourers&rsquo; Dwellings Society, and other bodies of similar
kind.&nbsp; The success of Miss Octavia Hill in encouraging the
construction of dwellings of the class required is well known, as
are the buildings erected by Sir Sydney Waterlow, Mr. G. Cutt,
and Mr. Newson.&nbsp; It is almost needless to add that the
Baroness Burdett-Coutts has taken a warm interest in this
important movement, as a building at Shoreditch now accommodating
seven hundred persons will testify.</p>

155</span>VII.&mdash;STUDIES AT THE BAR.</h2>
<p>On Christmas Eve, in the midst of a dense fog that filled
one&rsquo;s throat and closed one&rsquo;s eyes, and rendered the
vast City one huge sepulchre, as it were, peopled by ghosts and
ghouls, I spent a few hours in what may be called studies at the
bar.</p>
<p>First, I turned my steps down Whitechapel way.&nbsp; It is
there the pressure of poverty is felt as much as anywhere in
London, and as it was early in the evening I went there, I saw it
under favourable circumstances, for the sober people would be
shopping, and the drunken ones would scarcely have commenced that
riot and <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>quarrelling which are the result in most cases of
indulgence in alcohol.&nbsp; From the publican&rsquo;s point of
view, of course, I had nothing to expect but unmitigated
pleasure.&nbsp; The stuff they sell, they tell us, is the gift of
a good Providence, sent us in order to alleviate the gloom and
lighten the cares of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a poor heart that
never rejoices,&rdquo; and on Christmas Eve, when we are thinking
of the birth of Him who came to send peace on earth and goodwill
amongst men, a little extra enjoyment may be expected.&nbsp; In
some bars ample provision had been made for the event;
decorations had been freely resorted to, and everything had been
done to give colour to the delusion that Christmas jollity was to
be produced and heightened by the use of what the publican had to
sell.&nbsp; Almost the first glimpse I got of the consequences of
adherence to this doctrine was at a corner house in Whitechapel,
before I got as far as the church, where from the <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>side-door
of a gin-palace rushed out a little dirty woman with a pot of
beer in her hand, followed by a taller one, who, catching hold of
her, began to hit her.&nbsp; On this the attacked woman took a
savage grip of the front hair of her opponent, who began to
scream &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; with might and main.&nbsp; A crowd
was formed immediately, in the expectation of that favourite
entertainment of a certain section of the British public&mdash;a
free fight between two tipsy women; but, alas! they were too far
gone to fight, and, after a good deal of bad language, the woman
with the porter pursued her victorious way, while the other,
almost too drunk to stand, returned to the bar, to rejoin the
dirty group she had left, and to be served again&mdash;contrary,
as I understand, to the law of the land&mdash;with the liquor of
which she had already had more than enough.&nbsp; In that
compartment everything was dirty&mdash;the women at the bar and
the man behind it, <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>nor was there a spark of good feeling or happiness in
the group.&nbsp; There they were&mdash;the wives and mothers of
the people&mdash;all equally besotted, all equally
wretched.&nbsp; Oh heavens, what a sight!</p>
<p>And this reminds me of what I saw at a bar in the Gray&rsquo;s
Inn Road, in one of the largest of the many houses opened for
refreshment, as it is called.&nbsp; In one compartment there were
some thirty or forty wretched, dirty, ragged people, mostly
women.&nbsp; One of them was in a state of elevation, and was
dancing to a set who were evidently too far gone to appreciate
her performance.&nbsp; With tipsy gravity, however, she continued
her self-appointed task.&nbsp; Ah, poor thing! thought I, you are
gay and hilarious now&mdash;to-morrow you will lie shivering in
the cold&mdash;possibly crying for a morsel of bread.&nbsp; You
have a garret to sleep in, and nothing to look forward to but the
hospital or the workhouse.&nbsp; Heaven <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>wills it,
says the pietist.&nbsp; Heaven does nothing of the kind.&nbsp; In
the mad debauchery I saw in that bar I am sure there must have
been spent money that would have given the wretched topers
happier homes, better dinners, and a future far happier than that
which I saw hanging over them.</p>
<p>In Chancery Lane I came on several illustrations of the joyous
conviviality of the season.&nbsp; One poor fellow just before me
came down with a tremendous crash.&nbsp; Another nearly ran me
down as he steered his difficult way along the slippery street
and through the gloomy fog.&nbsp; Another merry old soul had
given up all attempt to find his way home, and had seated himself
on a doorstep, planted his hat on one side of his head, put his
hands in his pockets to keep them warm, and there, asleep, with a
short pipe in his mouth, and his legs stretched out, looked as
mournful and <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>seedy an object as anyone could desire to
contemplate.&nbsp; He had evidently been having a pleasant
evening with his companions over a social glass, merely keeping
up good old English customs, wishing himself and everyone he knew
a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>At the gin-palaces near the railway termini, and in those
bordering on any place of general marketing, the crowd of
customers was enormous, and the class was far superior to those I
saw in Drury Lane or Whitechapel, or the Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Road.&nbsp; They were real respectable working men and their
wives, who had been out marketing for the morrow, and who, proud
of their success in that direction, and of the store of good
things they had collected for the anticipated dinner, had to
treat themselves with a parting glass ere they went home.&nbsp;
It was a busy time for the men at the bar.&nbsp; In one large
public with <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>four or five compartments, I reckoned there must have
been nearly a hundred customers.&nbsp; It was quite an effort for
anyone to get served; he had to fight his way through the mob to
pay his money and get his glass, and then to struggle back to a
quiet corner to drink off its contents with a friend or his wife,
but there was no drunkenness.</p>
<p>The men and women of the respectable working class are not
drunkards.&nbsp; They have too much sense for that, but they were
merry, and a little inclined to be too talkative and
heedless.&nbsp; For instance, a party of four went straight from
a public-house to a railway station at which I happened to be
waiting.&nbsp; One couple were going by the train
home&mdash;another couple had come to see them off.&nbsp; The
wife of the travelling party was fat and heavy, and in her jolly,
careless mood, induced by the evening&rsquo;s conviviality, as
the train came up she missed her step and fell between the <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>wheels and
the platform.&nbsp; Fortunately the train had come to a
standstill, or that woman and her husband and her family would
have had anything but a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>In one place, patronised by navvies and their wives, there was
such a hideous exhibition of indecency that I may not record
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you interfere?&rdquo; said a
gentleman to the pot-boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t say anything at this season of the
year.&nbsp; It is best to leave them alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such low neighbourhoods as Drury Lane it seemed to me that
the men preponderated; indeed, at many places they were the only
customers.&nbsp; One could not much wonder to find them in such
places.&nbsp; Either they live in the low lodging-houses close
by, where they pay fourpence a night for a bed, or they have a
room for themselves and families in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>In neither
case is there much peace for them in what they call their
home.&nbsp; They are best out of doors, and then comes the
attraction of the public-house, and on Christmas Eve in the dull
raw fog almost the only bright spot visible was the gleam of its
gaudy splendour, and as a natural consequence bars were pretty
well filled.&nbsp; They always are in poor neighbourhoods of a
night, and especially such as have a corner situation.&nbsp; It
is always good times with the proprietors of such places, even if
trade be bad and men are out of work, and little children cry for
bread and old people die of starvation and want.&nbsp; A corner
public-house is never driven into the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>But let me change the scene.&nbsp; These low neighbourhoods
are really disgusting to people of cultivated minds and refined
tastes.&nbsp; I am standing in a wonderfully beautiful
hall.&nbsp; On one side is a long <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>counter filled with decanters and
wineglasses.&nbsp; Behind these are some lively young ladies,
fashionably dressed, and with hair elaborately arranged.&nbsp;
The customers are chiefly young men, whom Albert Smith would have
described as gents.&nbsp; They mostly patronise what they call
&ldquo;bittah&rdquo; beer, and they are wise in doing so, as
young men rarely can afford wine, and &ldquo;bittah&rdquo; beer
is not so likely to affect the few brains they happen to have
about them.&nbsp; Of course a good deal of wine is drunk, and
there is a great demand for grog, but beer is the prevailing
beverage; and as to tea and coffee and such things, they are
unfairly handicapped, as the Hebe at the bar charges me sixpence
for a small cup of coffee, while the gent by my side pays but
twopence for his beer; nor can I say that he pays too much, as he
has the opportunity thus afforded to him of talking to a young
lady who has no refuge from <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>his impertinence, and who is bound
to be civil unless the cad is notoriously offensive, as her trade
is to sell liquor, and the more he talks the more he
drinks.&nbsp; But the mischief does not end here.&nbsp; Many a
married man fancies it is fun to loll over the counter and spoon
with the girls behind.&nbsp; He has more cash than the gent, and
spends more.&nbsp; If he is not a rich man he would pass himself
off as such; he drinks more than is good for him; he makes the
young ladies presents; he talks to them in a sentimental strain,
and it may be he has a wife and family at home who are in need of
almost the necessaries of life.</p>
<p>In many cases the end of all this is wretchedness at home and
loss of character and means of subsistence; if he is in a house
of business he lives beyond his income, and embezzlement is the
result.&nbsp; If he be in business on his own account his end is
bankruptcy, at any rate his health <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>is not benefited by his indulgence
at the bar, and to most men who have to earn their daily bread
loss of health is loss of employment and poverty, more or less
enduring and grinding and complete.&nbsp; What the gin-shop is to
the working man, the restaurant and the refreshment bar are to
the middle classes of society.&nbsp; There is no disgrace in
dropping in there, and so the young man learns to become a
sot.&nbsp; Planted as they are at all the railway termini, they
are an ever-present danger; they are fitted up in a costly style,
and the young ladies are expected to be as amiable and
good-looking as possible, and thus when a young man has a few
minutes to spare at a railway terminus, naturally he makes his
way to the refreshment bar.</p>
<p>Dartmoor was full, writes the author of &ldquo;Convict
Life,&rdquo; with the men whom drink had led into
crime&mdash;from the mean wretch who pawned his wife&rsquo;s
boots for ninepence, <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>which he spent in the gin-shop, to
the young man from the City who became enamoured &ldquo;with one
of the painted and powdered decoy-ducks who are on exhibition at
the premises of a notorious publican within a mile of Regent
Circus.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first he spent a shilling or two nightly;
but he quickly found that the road to favour was at bottle of
Mo&euml;t, of which his <i>inamorata</i> and her painted sisters
partook very freely.&nbsp; The acquaintance soon ripened under
the influence of champagne till he robbed his employer, and was
sent to Dartmoor.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told me himself,&rdquo; writes
our author, &ldquo;that from the time he first went to that
tavern he never went to bed perfectly sober, and that all his
follies were committed under the influence of
champagne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another case he mentions was even worse.&nbsp; At the time of
his conviction the young man of whom he writes was on the eve of
passing an examination for one of the <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>learned professions; but be had been
an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the buffet of let us call it the
Royal Grill Room Theatre and a lounger at the stage door of that
celebrated establishment, and had made the acquaintance of one of
the ladies of the ballet.&nbsp; Under the influence of champagne
he also soon came to grief.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the name of
God,&rdquo; says the writer to young men in London, &ldquo;turn
up taverns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what is to be done?&nbsp; The publican, whether he keeps a
gin-palace or a refreshment bar, must push his trade.&nbsp; The
total number of public-houses, beershops, and wine-houses in the
Metropolitan Parliamentary boroughs is 8,973, or one to each 333
persons.&nbsp; This is bad; but Newcastle-on-Tyne is worse,
having one public-house to 160 inhabitants, and Manchester has
one to every 164 inhabitants.&nbsp; The amount paid in
license-fees by publicans in the Metropolitan district last year
amounted to <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&pound;108,316; the total for the kingdom being
&pound;1,133,212.&nbsp; But great as is the number of these
places, the trade flourishes.&nbsp; A licensed house in one of
the finest parts of London (Bethnal Green), lately sold for
upwards of &pound;22,000.&nbsp; Another, a third or fourth rate
house in North London, sold for &pound;18,000; other licensed
houses sell for &pound;30,000, &pound;40,000, &pound;50,000, and
even more.&nbsp; As to the refreshment bars, it lately came out
in evidence that a partner in one of the firms most connected
with them stated his income to be &pound;40,000 a year.&nbsp; It
is said one firm, whose business is chiefly devoted to
refreshment bars, pays its wine merchants as much as &pound;1,000
a week.</p>

170</span>VIII.&mdash;IN AN OPIUM DEN.</h2>
<p>An effort is being made by a band of British philanthropists,
of which the Rev. Mr. Turner is secretary, to put down, if not
the opium traffic, at any rate that part of it which is covered
by the British flag.&nbsp; Opium is to the Chinese what the quid
is to the British tar, or the gin-bottle to the London
charwoman.&nbsp; But in reality, as I firmly believe, for the
purpose of opening the door to all sorts of bribery and
corruption, the traffic is prohibited as much as possible by the
Chinese Government, for the ostensible object of preserving the
health and morals of the people.&nbsp; This task is a very
difficult <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>one.&nbsp; A paternal Government is always in
difficulties, and once we Christian people of England have gone
to war with the Chinese in order to make them take our
Indian-grown opium&mdash;a manufacture in which a large capital
is invested, and the duty of which yields the British Government
in India a magnificent revenue.&nbsp; It is a question for the
moralist to decide how far a Government is justified in saying to
a people: &ldquo;We know so and so is bad, but as you will use
it, you may as well pay a heavy tax on its use.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is the practical way in which statesmen look at it, and of course
there is a good deal to be said for that view.&nbsp; But it is
not pleasant to feel that money, even if it be used for State
purposes, is made in a dirty manner; though I have been in
countries where the minister of the religion of holiness and
purity is content to take a part of his living from the
brothel-keeper and the prostitute.&nbsp; Evidently there <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>are many
men as ready to take the devil&rsquo;s money as was Rowland Hill
to accept the Bible at his hands.</p>
<p>But I am touching on questions not to be settled in the
twinkling of an eye, or by a phrase or two in print.&nbsp;
Perhaps I may best serve the cause of humanity if, instead of
saying what I think and feel, I merely content myself with
describing what I saw in the East-End of London, one Saturday
night, in this year of grace one thousand eight hundred and
seventy-five.</p>
<p>Have my readers ever been in Bluegate Fields, somewhere down
Ratcliffe Highway?&nbsp; The glory of the place is
departed.&nbsp; I am writing <i>more Americano</i>, where the
wickedest man in the town is always regarded as a hero.&nbsp; The
City missionary and the East London Railway between them have
reformed the place.&nbsp; To the outward eye it is a waste
howling spot, but it is a garden of Eden to what it was when a
policeman <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>dared not go by himself into its courts, and when
respectability, if it ever strayed into that filthy quarter,
generally emerged from it minus its watch and coat, and with a
skull more or less cracked, and with a face more or less
bloody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you,&rdquo; said a surgeon to a City
missionary who has been labouring in the spot some sixteen years,
and is now recognised as a friend wherever he goes, &ldquo;thanks
to you,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;I can now walk along the
place alone, and in safety, a thing I never expected to
do;&rdquo; and I believe that the testimony is true, and that it
is in such districts the labours of the City missionary are
simply invaluable.&nbsp; Down in those parts what we call the
Gospel has very little power.&nbsp; It is a thing quite outside
the mass.&nbsp; There are chapels and churches, it is true, but
the people don&rsquo;t go into them.&nbsp; I pass a great
Wesleyan I chapel.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is it attended?&rdquo; I <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>ask; and
the answer is: &ldquo;Very badly indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hear that
the nearest Independent chapel is turned into a School Board
school; and there is Rehoboth,&mdash;I need not say it is a hyper
place of worship, and was, when Bluegate Fields was a teeming
mass of godless men and women, only attended by some dozen or so
of the elect, who prayed their prayers, and read their Bible, and
listened to their parsons with sublime indifference to the fact
that there at their very door, under their very eyes, within
reach of their very hands, were souls to be saved, and brands to
be snatched from the burning, and jewels to be won for the
Redeemer&rsquo;s crown.&nbsp; I can only hear of one preacher in
this part who is really getting the people to hear him, and he is
the Rev. Harry Jones, who deserves to be made a bishop, and who
would be, if the Church of England was wise and knew its dangers,
and was careful to avert the impending <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>storm,
which I, though I may not live to see the day, know to be
near.&nbsp; But let us pass, on leaving Rehoboth, a black and
ugly carcass, on the point of being pulled down by the
navvy.&nbsp; I turn into a little court on my right, one of the
very few the railway has spared for the present.&nbsp; It may be
there are some dozen houses in the court.&nbsp; The population
is, I should certainly imagine, quite up to the accommodation of
the place.&nbsp; Indeed, if I might venture to make a remark, it
would be to the effect that a little more elbow-room would be of
great advantage to all.&nbsp; From every door across the court
are ropes, and on these ropes the blankets and sheets and family
linen are hanging up to dry.&nbsp; These I have to duck under as
I walk along; but the people are all civil, though my appearance
makes them stare, and all give a friendly and respectful greeting
to the City missionary by my side.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>All
at once my conductor disappears in a little door, and I follow,
walking, on this particular occasion, by faith, and not by sight;
for the passage was dark, and I knew not my way.&nbsp; I climb up
a flight of stairs, and find myself in a little crib&mdash;it
would be an abuse of terms to call it a room.&nbsp; It is just
about my height, and I fancy it is a great deal darker and
dingier than the room in which a first-class misdemeanant like
Colonel Baker was confined.&nbsp; The place is full of
smoke.&nbsp; It is not at first that I take in its
contents.&nbsp; As I stand by the door, there are two beds of an
ancient character; between these beds is a very narrow passage,
and it is in this passage I recognise the master of the
house&mdash;a black-eyed, cheerful Chinaman, who has become so
far naturalised amongst us as to do us the honour of taking the
truly British name of Johnson.&nbsp; Johnson is but thinly
clad.&nbsp; I see the perspiration glistening on his <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>dark and
shining skin; but Johnson seems as pleased to see me as if he had
known me fifty years.&nbsp; In time, through the smoke, I see
Johnson&rsquo;s friends&mdash;dark, perspiring figures curled on
the beds around, one, for want of room, squatting, cross-legged,
in a corner&mdash;each with a tube of the shape and size of a
German flute in his hands.&nbsp; I look at this tube with some
curiosity.&nbsp; In the middle of it is a little bowl.&nbsp; In
that little bowl is the opium, which is placed there as if it
were a little bit of tow dipped in tar, and which is set fire to
by being held to the little lamps, of which there are three or
four on the bed or in the room.&nbsp; This operation performed,
the smoker reclines and draws up the smoke, and looks a very
picture of happiness and ease.&nbsp; Of course I imitate the bad
example; I like to do as the Romans do, and Johnson hands me a
tube which I put into my mouth, while, as I hold it to the lamp,
he <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>inserts the heated opium into the bowl; and, as I pull,
the thick smoke curls up and adds to the cloud which makes the
room as oppressive as the atmosphere of a Turkish bath.&nbsp; How
the little pig-eyes glisten! and already I feel that I may say:
&ldquo;Am I not a man and a brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
conversation becomes general.&nbsp; Here we are jolly companions
every one.&nbsp; Ching tells me the Chinese don&rsquo;t send us
the best tea; and grins all across his yellow face as I say that
I know that, but intimate that they make us pay for it as if they
did.&nbsp; Tsing smiles knowingly as I ask him what his wife does
when he is so long away.&nbsp; Then we have a discussion as to
the comparative merits of opium and beer, and my Chinese friends
sagely observe that it is all a matter of taste.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mans like beer, and we mans in our country like
opium.&rdquo;&nbsp; All were unanimous in saying that they never
had more than a few whiffs, and all <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>that I could learn of its effects
when taken in excess was that opium sent them off into a stupid
sleep.&nbsp; With the somewhat doubtful confessions of De Quincey
and Coleridge in my memory, I tried to get them to acknowledge
sudden impulses, poetic inspirations, splendid dreams; but of
such things these little fellows had never conceived; the highest
eulogium I heard was: &ldquo;You have pains&mdash;pain in de
liver, pain in de head&mdash;you smoke&mdash;all de pains
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most that I could learn was that opium is an
expensive luxury for a poor man.&nbsp; Three-halfpenny-worth only
gives you a few minutes&rsquo; smoke, and these men say they
don&rsquo;t smoke more at a time.&nbsp; Lascar Sall, a rather
disreputable female, well known in the neighbourhood, would, they
told me, smoke five shillings-worth of opium a day.&nbsp;
Johnson&rsquo;s is the clubhouse of the Chinese.&nbsp; He buys
the opium and prepares it for smoking, and they come <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>and smoke
and have a chat, and a cup of tea and a slice of bread and
butter, and go back and sleep on board ship.&nbsp; Their little
smoking seemed to do them no harm.&nbsp; The City missionary says
he has never seen them intoxicated.&nbsp; It made them a little
lazy and sleepy&mdash;that is all; but they had done their
day&rsquo;s work, and had earned as much title to a little
indulgence as the teetotaler, who regales himself with coffee; or
the merchant, who smokes his cigar on his pleasant lawn on a
summer&rsquo;s eve.&nbsp; I own when I left the room I felt a
little giddy, that I had to walk the crowded streets with care;
but then I was a novice, and the effect would not be so great on
a second trial.&nbsp; I should have enjoyed a cup of good coffee
after; but that is a blessing to which we in London, with all our
boasted civilisation, have not attained.&nbsp; I frankly avow, as
I walked to the railway station, I almost wished myself back in
the opium den.&nbsp; <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>There I heard no foul language, saw
no men and women fighting, no sots reeling into the gutters, or
for safety shored up against the wall.&nbsp; For it was thus the
mob, through which I had to pass, was preparing itself for the
services of the sanctuary, and the rest of the Sabbath.</p>

182</span>IX.&mdash;LONDON&rsquo;S EXCURSIONISTS.</h2>
<p>Most of my London readers know Southend.&nbsp; It is as pretty
a place, when the tide is up and the weather is fine, as you can
find anywhere near London.&nbsp; Standing on the cliff on a clear
day it is a lovely panorama which greets your eye.&nbsp; At your
feet rolls the noble river, to which London owes its greatness,
and on which sail up and down, night and day, no matter how
stormy the season may be, the commercial navies of the
world.&nbsp; On the other side is the mouth of the Medway, with
its docks and men-of-war; and farther still beyond rise those
Kentish hills of which Dickens was so fond, and on the top <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of one of
which he lived and died.&nbsp; Look to the right, and you see
over the broad expanse of waters and the marshy land, destined,
perhaps, at some distant day to be formed into docks and to be
crowded with busy life.&nbsp; Look at your left, and the old
town, with its pier a mile and a quarter long, really looks
charming in the summer sun.&nbsp; Or you see the shingly beach,
at one end of which&mdash;you learn by report of artillery-firing
and the cloud of blue smoke curling to the sky&mdash;is
Shoeburyness.&nbsp; Far away on the open sea, and on the other
side, the tall cliffs of the Isle of Sheppey loom in the
distance.</p>
<p>Lie down on the grass and enjoy yourself.&nbsp; What ozone
there is in the atmosphere!&nbsp; What brightness in the
scene!&nbsp; What joy seems all around!&nbsp; Is it not pleasant,
after the roar and bustle and smoke and dirt of London, to come
down here and watch the clouds casting their dark shadow on the
blue waters; or to follow the gulls, dipping <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>and darting
along like so many white flies; or to see the feathery sails of
yachts and pleasure-boats, floating like flakes of snow; or to
mark the dark track from the funnel of yon steamer, on her way
(possibly with a cargo of emigrants, to whom fortune had been
unfriendly at home) to some Australian El Dorado&mdash;to which,
if I only knew of it, I might probably go myself&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where every man is free,<br />
And none can be in bonds for life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For want of &pound; s. d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, you say, this is a fairy spot, a real Eden, where life
is all enjoyment, where health and happiness abound, if you could
live but always there.&nbsp; My dear sir, in a few hours such a
change will come over the spirit of the dream, such a diabolical
transformation will be effected, so foul will seem all that now
is so bright and fair, that you will flee the place, and, as you
do so, I indignantly ask, What is the use of <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>British
law? and wherein consists the virtue of British civilisation? and
of what avail is British Christianity, if in broad daylight, in
the principal thoroughfares of the town, your eyes and ears are
to be shocked by scenes of which I can only say that they would
be deemed disgraceful in a land of savages?&nbsp; Let us suppose
it midday, and the usual excursion trains and steamboats have
landed some few thousand men, women, and children, all dressed in
their best, and determined, and very properly, to enjoy
themselves.&nbsp; What swarms you see everywhere!&nbsp; One day
actually, I am told, the railway brought as many as eleven
thousand.&nbsp; You say you are glad to see them; they have
worked hard for a holiday; and, shut up in the factories, and
warehouses, and workshops of the East-End, none have more of a
right to, or more of a need of, the enjoyment of a sea air.&nbsp;
Dear sir, you are right; and for a little while all goes on as
you <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>desire.&nbsp; The enjoyment is varied, and seems to
consist of wading up to the knees in the sea, in listening to
Ethiopian serenaders, in the consumption of oysters and apples,
in donkey-riding, in the purchase of useless ware at the nearest
caravan or booth, in being photographed, in taking a sail, or in
strolling about the beach, and, as regards the male part of the
excursionists, smoking tobacco more or less indifferent.&nbsp;
But unfortunately the trains do not return before seven or eight
o&rsquo;clock, and of course the excursionists must have a drop
of beer or spirits to pass away the time, many of them have no
idea of a holiday, and really and truly cannot enjoy themselves
without; and the publicans of Southend lay themselves out for the
gratification of the excursionist in this respect.&nbsp; They
have monster taps and rooms in which the excursionists sit and
drink and make merry according to their custom.&nbsp; As the day
wears on the merriment becomes <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>greater, and the noise a little less
harmonious.&nbsp; The fact is, all parties&mdash;men and women
alike&mdash;have taken a drop too much; the publican begins to
feel a little anxious about his property, especially as the two
or three policemen belonging to the place&mdash;wisely knowing
what is coming, and their utter inability to cope with a drunken
mob, and the ridiculousness of their attempting to do
so&mdash;manage to get out of the way, and to hide their
diminished heads in a quieter and more respectable quarter of the
town.</p>
<p>At length quarrels arise, oaths and coarse language are heard,
and out in the street rush angry men to curse, and swear, and
fight.&nbsp; The women, it must be confessed, are ofttimes as bad
as the men, and I have seen many a heavy blow fall to the lot
even of the sucking babe!&nbsp; In the brief madness of the hour,
friends, brothers, relatives rush at each other like so many wild
beasts, <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>much to the amusement of the throng of inebriated
pleasure-seekers around.&nbsp; No one tries to interfere, as most
of the men and cardrivers, who make up the aboriginal population
of the place, evidently enjoy the disgusting spectacle.&nbsp;
Once I stopped four weeks in this place, and I began to tremble
at the very sight of an excursionist.&nbsp; I knew that the
chances were that before the day was over my little ones would
have to look on the worst of sights.&nbsp; I saw one powerful
fellow in three fights in the course of one day; in one he had
kicked a man in a way which made him shriek and howl for an hour
afterwards; in another case he had knocked a woman down; and I
left him on the railway platform, stripped, and offering to fight
anyone.&nbsp; I begged a policeman to interfere and take the
brute into custody, and in reply was told that their rule was
never to take a man into custody unless they saw the assault
committed, a thing the <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Southend police very properly take
care never to do; and yet on the occasion to which I refer the
landlord of one of the best hotels in the place was in vain, for
the sake of his respectable guests, begging the police to put a
stop to the scene which he himself rightly described as
pandemonium.&nbsp; I must admit the police are not
inactive.&nbsp; There was a crowd round the beershop, from which
a man hopelessly intoxicated was being ejected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, policeman,&rdquo; said the beershop-keeper,
&ldquo;take this man away, he has insulted me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
the policeman complied with his request, and the poor fellow, who
was too drunk to stand upright, speedily embraces mother
earth.&nbsp; On another occasion a policeman displayed unusual
activity.&nbsp; He was after a man who had stolen actually an
oyster, and for this the policeman was on his track, and the man
was to be conveyed at the expense <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of the country to Rochford
gaol.&nbsp; Let me draw a veil over the horrors of the return
home of an excursion train with its tipsy occupants, swearing
eternal friendship one moment while trying to tear each
other&rsquo;s eyes out the next.&nbsp; It is bad enough to see
the excursionists making their way back to the railway station;
here a couple of men will be holding up a drunken mate, there are
flushed boys and girls yelling and shrieking like so many escaped
lunatics.&nbsp; Now let us retrace our steps.&nbsp; You can tell
by the disorder and ruin all around where the excursionists have
been, their steps are as manifest to the observer as an invading
army.&nbsp; Is there no remedy for this state of things?&nbsp; Is
a quiet watering-place, to which people go to recover health and
strength, to be at the mercy of any drunken swarms who happen to
have the half-crowns in their pockets requisite for the purchase
of an excursion ticket?&nbsp; Of course this is a free country,
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>and the
right of a man to go to the devil his own way is a right of which
I would be the last to deprive my fellow citizens; but an
excursion train is a monster nuisance, of which our ancestors
never dreamed, and for which in their wisdom they made no
provision.&nbsp; Of course total abstinence is a remedy; but then
the British workman is not a total abstainer, and that is a
question which I am not about to discuss.&nbsp; All I want is to
call attention to what is a daily scandal in the summer-time; and
to bid good people remember&mdash;while they are talking of
heathenism abroad&mdash;that heathenism at home, which, under the
influence of strong drink threatens to destroy all that is lovely
and of good report in our midst.</p>
<p>Lest it be said that I exaggerate, that I give an erroneous
idea of the drinking customs of the working classes, let me quote
the following confession of a working man, when examined before a
coroner&rsquo;s jury, as <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>to the way in which he had spent his
holiday last Good Friday:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went for a walk, and had two pints of beer on the
road.&nbsp; We got as far as the Holloway Road Railway Station,
and turned back.&nbsp; Deceased saw me home, and then left
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he again call on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; at about twenty minutes to three
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By appointment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to go to the Alexandra Palace.&nbsp; We left my
place about a quarter to three o&rsquo;clock, and just had time
for a drink at the public-house next door to where I am
living.&nbsp; We had two half-quarterns of whisky neat.&nbsp; I
there changed a sovereign.&nbsp; We then walked up the Holloway
Road, and I called on my father-in-law.&nbsp; He asked me to stop
to tea, but I said I was engaged to go to the Palace.&nbsp;
Deceased and I then got as far as The Manor House, where we had
two glasses of bitter <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>beer.&nbsp; We went on farther to
The Queen&rsquo;s Head, which is the next public-house, and had
some more drink.&nbsp; From there we went to Hornsey, stopped at
a public-house, and had some whisky.&nbsp; We stopped again at
The Nightingale, and had half-a-quartern of whisky each.&nbsp; We
could see the Palace from where we then were, but did not know
how to get there.&nbsp; We inquired the way, and as we were going
along we met the deceased&rsquo;s younger brother, with a lot of
other boys, and we said a few words to them.&nbsp; Afterwards we
went into a public-house just opposite the Palace gates, and had
either some brandy or whisky, I don&rsquo;t know which.&nbsp; We
got chaffing with the man at the pay-office, saying that he ought
to let us in at half-price, as it was so late, but he did not do
so.&nbsp; We paid one shilling each to go in.&nbsp; We went into
the building and strolled about, looking at different things, and
had three pints of bitter ale at one of the stands.&nbsp; <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>We then
walked about again, and afterwards had some brandy.&nbsp; We then
began to get rather stupefied, and after waiting about a little
longer we had some more brandy.&nbsp; I know we stopped at almost
every buffet there was in the Palace, and had something to drink
at each of them.&nbsp; The lights were being put out as we left
the Palace.&nbsp; Deceased had hold of my arm, and we went up to
one of the buffets for the purpose of getting some cakes, or
something to eat, but the barmaid refused to serve us.&nbsp;
Deceased said to me, &lsquo;I feel rather tidy, Joe,&rsquo; so I
took hold of his arm, but in moving away we both fell over some
chairs.&nbsp; We left the Palace, and deceased said to me,
&lsquo;Have you got any money?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;Yes;
what I have got you are welcome to.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then gave him
a two-shilling piece, out of my purse, which he put with the
money he already had of his own.&nbsp; It must have been very
late then.&nbsp; We lost our way, but <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>I think I said to the deceased,
&lsquo;This is the way we came in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then we both fell
down again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember getting away from there,
or how I left deceased.&nbsp; I remember nothing else that took
place.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how we got on the steps of the
Grand Stand.&nbsp; I cannot remember seeing the boy Braybrook,
nor how I got out of the grounds, or to my own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that you were drunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were both drunk, almost before we got to the
Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that the deceased was also drunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember leaving the deceased upon the
ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot remember how I got my hands cut, or the
bruise on the back of my head.&nbsp; I found my hat broken in the
next morning, and my wife put it right for me.&rdquo;</p>

196</span>X.&mdash;ON THE RIVER STEAMERS.</h2>
<p>One fine summer day a friend agreed with me to go down the
river.&nbsp; Sheerness was fixed on, not on account of its
beauty, for that part near the harbour is by no means attractive,
and like most of our naval and military stations it is full of
low public-houses, which by no means add to its attractions, but
simply on account of the fact that the place could be reached and
the return journey made in the course of a day; that we could be
on the water all the while, and that we should have a pleasant
breathing space in the midst of a life more or less necessarily
of toil.&nbsp; For people <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>who cannot get away for a few weeks,
who cannot rush off to Brighton, or Margate, or Scarborough, or
Scotland for a month, it is a great treat to be able to go down
to Sheerness and back for a day in a luxurious steamer, where
everyone has elbow-room.&nbsp; And on the day in question it was
a treat to us all in many respects; the day was fine, the boat in
which we sailed was that favourite one the <i>Princess
Alice</i>&mdash;now, alas! a name which sends a thrill of tragic
horror through the land.&nbsp; To us and the public at that time
she was known merely as the safest, and fastest, and pleasantest
vessel of her class.</p>
<p>We had beautiful views of marshes well filled with cattle, and
of fields waving with yellow corn, and with hills and green
parks, and gentlemen&rsquo;s seats and churches afar off; the
river with its craft great and small going up or coming down is
always a source of interesting study; and as the fine fresh <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>air, to be
encountered below Gravesend, gave us an appetite, we had a good
dinner on board, well served and at a very moderate price; tea
and shrimps at a later period of the day were equally acceptable;
and many were the ladies and gentlemen who had come and found
what they sought, a pleasant outing.&nbsp; There were also many
little children who enjoyed themselves much, and the sight of
whose pleasure was an unmitigated enjoyment to old stagers, like
myself and my friend.&nbsp; Altogether it was a very agreeable
day so far as the outward passage was concerned.&nbsp; It was
true that there was an unnecessary demand for beer, even from the
moderate drinker&rsquo;s point of view, before the dinner
hour.&nbsp; Bottled ale and stout may not be taken with impunity
on an empty stomach; smoking may also be carried to excess, and
as there are many persons who dislike the very smell of it, the
mixture in the <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>atmosphere was certainly far more than was desirable;
but on a holiday on a Thames excursion boat one must give and
take, and not be too prone to find fault.&nbsp; People often act
differently abroad to what they do at home; we must allow for a
little wildness on such an occasion on the part of the general
public.&nbsp; It is not every day a man takes a holiday.&nbsp; It
is not everyone who knows how to use it when he has it.&nbsp; To
many of us a holiday rarely comes more than once a year, and
gentlemen of my profession, alas! often do not get that.</p>
<p>Altogether we must have had at the least some seven or eight
hundred people on board.&nbsp; They swarmed everywhere; indeed,
at times there was little more than comfortable standing room,
and the only locomotion possible seemed to be that directed
towards the cabins fore and aft in pursuit of bottled beer.</p>
<p>In the morning we were not so crowded, <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>but in the
evening we began to experience inconvenience of another
kind.&nbsp; It was at half-past ten <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span> that we left the lower side of London
Bridge; it was nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening when we arrived
there again.&nbsp; All that time we had been on board the
steamer, with the exception of an hour and a half spent at
Sheerness, and all that time the demand for beer had been
incessant.&nbsp; I never in all my life saw such a
consumption.&nbsp; I remarked to a friend enough beer had been
drunk to have floated apparently the <i>Princess Alice</i>
herself.&nbsp; Everybody was drinking beer or porter, and the
bottles were imperial pints and held a good deal.&nbsp; Of course
there were music and dancing; and the girls, flushed and excited,
drank freely of the proffered beverage, each moment getting
wilder and noisier.&nbsp; Old ladies and old gentlemen
complacently sipped their glass.&nbsp; It seemed to do them no
harm.&nbsp; Their passions had long been extinct.&nbsp; They <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>had long
outlived the heyday of youth.&nbsp; All that the beer seemed to
do for them was to give them a bit of a headache, or to make them
feel a little more tired or sleepy, that was all.&nbsp; On the
deck was a party of thirty or forty men who had come for a
day&rsquo;s outing; decent mechanics evidently, very respectably
dressed.&nbsp; They kept themselves to themselves, had dined on
board together, had taken tea together, and now sat singing all
the way home, in dreadfully melancholy tones, all the old songs
of our grandfathers&rsquo; days about &ldquo;Remembering those
out,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Maids of merry, merry England,&rdquo; and
then came a yell in the way of a chorus which would have
frightened a Red Indian or a Zulu Kaffir.&nbsp; After every song
there was a whip round for some more beer, till the seats
underneath seemed to be choked up with empty bottles.&nbsp; They
were all a little under the influence of liquor, not unpleasantly
so, but placidly and stupidly; and as they <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>listened
with the utmost gravity while one or another of the party was
singing, you would have thought they were all being tried for
manslaughter at least.&nbsp; It is true they had a comic man in
the party, with a green necktie and a billycock hat, and a
shillalagh, who did his best under the circumstances, but he had
to fight at tremendous odds, as hilarity was not the order of the
day on that part of the deck.</p>
<p>I went down into the cabin in search of it there, but was
equally unsuccessful.&nbsp; Every table was crammed with bottles
of beer.&nbsp; Opposite me was a picture indeed; a
respectable-looking man had drunk himself into a maudlin state,
from which his friends were in vain endeavouring to arouse
him.&nbsp; He was a widower, and was muttering something
unpleasant about <i>her</i> grave, which did not seem to accord
with the ideas of two gaily-dressed females&mdash;one of them
with a baby in her arms&mdash;who hovered around him, <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>as if
desirous to win him back to life and love and duty, his male
friends apparently having got tired of the hopeless task of
making him understand that he had been brought out with a view to
being agreeable, and to spending a happy day, and that he had no
right to finish up in so unreasonable a manner.&nbsp; Now and
then he appealed to me, declaring that he had no friends, or
promising in reply to the playful appeal of his female friends to
be a good boy and not to give them any more trouble, that it was
no use trying.&nbsp; It was the women who stuck to him alone, now
and then suggesting lemonade, and then forcing him up on deck
with a view to a dance or a promenade.&nbsp; Some of the
passengers around, as tipsy as himself, interfered; one of them,
evidently a respectable tradesman, with his wife and children
around, requesting the widower to sing &ldquo;John
Barleycorn,&rdquo; assuring him that as he had lost his teeth it
would have to be sung <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>with a <i>false set oh</i>, a joke
which the widower could not see, and the explanation of which at
one time seemed about to end in a serious misunderstanding.&nbsp;
Other parties besides interfered, and the confusion became
hopeless and inexplicable.&nbsp; It ended in the weeping widower
wildly embracing the female with the baby, and then making a mad
rush on deck with a view to jump over&mdash;a feat, however,
which he was easily prevented from accomplishing; and as I landed
I saw the would-be suicide with his male and female friends
contemplating a visit to the nearest public-house.&nbsp; It was
really a melancholy spectacle, and one that ought not to have
been permitted in the cabin of a saloon steamer.&nbsp; Quite as
pitiable in its way was the sight of a couple who had
unwarrantably intruded into that part of the steamer which is
presumed to be kept solely for the use of those who pay
first-class fares.&nbsp; One of them was indeed a <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>study; he
had been out for a day&rsquo;s pleasure, and he showed in his
person traces of very severe enjoyment; his clothes had been
damaged in the process, and an eye had been brought into close
contact with some very hard substance, such as a man&rsquo;s
fist, and the consequence was it was completely closed, and the
skin around discoloured and swollen.&nbsp; He had never, so he
said, been so insulted in his life, and once or twice he
reascended the stairs with a short pipe in his hand, a picture of
tipsy gravity, in order that he might recognise the ticket
collector, with a view apparently to summon him before the Lord
Mayor.&nbsp; His companion was a more blackguard-looking object
still.&nbsp; A couple of the officers attached to the ship soon
sent him forward, to mingle with a lot of men as disgusting in
appearance and as foul in language as himself, but who had sense
enough not to intrude where they had no right, and to keep their
proper places.&nbsp; And <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>thus the hours passed, and the sun
sank lower in the horizon, and we rushed up the mighty river past
outward-bound steamers on their way to all quarters of the globe,
and found ourselves once more in town.&nbsp; The day had been a
pleasant one had it not been for the indulgence in bottled beer,
which seems to be the special need of all Londoners when they go
up or down the river.&nbsp; If this state of things is to be
allowed, no decent person will be enabled to take a passage on a
river steamer on a St. Monday or a Saturday, especially if he has
ladies or children with him.&nbsp; It does seem hard that people
on board river steamers may drink to excess, and thus prove a
nuisance to all who are not as beery as themselves.&nbsp; It may
be, however, that the steam-packet companies promote this sale of
intoxicating liquor in order to promote the cause of true
temperance; if so, one can understand the unlimited activity of
the ship stewards, as it <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>becomes at once apparent to the most
superficial observer that he who tastes the charmed cup has</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost
his upright shape,<br />
And downwards falls into a grovelling swine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anyone doubts this let him proceed to Sheerness in a river
steamer on a people&rsquo;s day.</p>

208</span>XI.&mdash;STREET SALESMEN.</h2>
<p>That we are a nation of shopkeepers I believe, not only on the
evidence of the first Napoleon, but from what I see and hear
every day.&nbsp; There are few people in the City who are born
wealthy, compared with the number who do manage in the course of
a successful mercantile career to win for themselves a fair share
of this world&rsquo;s goods.&nbsp; The other night I was spending
the evening at the West-End mansion of a City millionaire.&nbsp;
As I left, I asked a friend what was the secret of our
host&rsquo;s success, &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; was the answer, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>&ldquo;I
have always understood he began life with borrowing ten
shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that is all, thought I to myself, it is not difficult to
make a fortune, after all.&nbsp; Accordingly, I negotiated a loan
of a sovereign, thinking that if I failed with ten shillings I
should be sure to succeed with double that number.&nbsp; At
present, I regret to say, the loan has not been so successful in
its results as I anticipated, and fortune seems as far off as
ever.&nbsp; Should it turn out otherwise, and my wild
expectations be realised, I will publish a book, and let the
reader know how a sovereign became ten thousand pounds.&nbsp; And
yet I believe such a feat has been often accomplished in the City
and by City men.&nbsp; Everybody knows a man who walked up to
town with twopence-halfpenny in his pocket, who lived to enjoy a
nice fortune himself, and to leave his wife and family well
provided for.</p>
<p>I met the other day in the Gray&rsquo;s Inn <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Road a
master-builder, who told me that he was going to retire from
business and pass the evening of his days in quiet.&nbsp; I had
known the man since he was a boy.&nbsp; I knew his father and his
mother and all his family.&nbsp; If ever a fellow had a chance of
going to the bad that poor boy had.&nbsp; His father was a
drunkard; the poverty of the family was extreme; of schooling he
had none whatever; yet he left the little village in Suffolk
where he was born, resolved, as he told me, to be either a man or
a mouse; and fortune favoured him beyond his most sanguine
expectations.&nbsp; Yes, the streets of London <i>are</i> paved
with gold, but it is not everyone who has sense to see it or
strength to pick it up.</p>
<p>It is to be feared the large class who come into the streets
to deal are not of the class who mean to rise, but who have seen
better days.&nbsp; For instance, I often meet a porter selling
Persian sherbet in the City, <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>who seems to have dropped into that
situation from mere laziness.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had a fair chance of
getting on in life, but he never seems to have had pluck enough
to succeed.&nbsp; Another man I know held a respectable situation
as clerk; he appeared to me economical in his habits, he was
always neatly dressed, he was never the worse for liquor, nor did
he seem to keep bad company.&nbsp; All at once he left his
situation, and rapidly went to the dogs.&nbsp; For a little while
he borrowed of his friends; but that was a precarious source of
existence, and now he may be seen dealing in small articles, on
which it is to be hoped for his own sake the profits are large,
as I fear the demand for them is small.&nbsp; Then there are the
restless characters who take up street-selling partly because
they like to gammon the public, partly because they dislike
steady industry, and partly because I fancy they cherish
expectations of another sort.&nbsp; These <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>are the men
who give away gold rings, who exhibit mice that have a wonderful
way of running up and down the arms, who sell gutta-percha dolls
which seem in their hands to have a power of vocalisation which
leaves them at once and for ever as soon as you have purchased
the puppet and paid for it and made it your own, who deal in
cement which will make an old jug better than new, who retail
corn-plasters which are an inevitable cure, and who occasionally
deal in powders which are a sure means of getting rid of certain
objectionable specimens of the insect tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you use the powder?&rdquo; asked a flat of a
countryman who had been deluded into the purchase of
sixpenny-worth of the invaluable powder.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you
use it?&rdquo; repeated the purchaser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, you catch the animal and hold him by the
back of the neck, and then when his mouth opens, just <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>shove in
the powder, and he&rsquo;ll die fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the countryman, &ldquo;I suppose I
could kill the insect at once when I&rsquo;ve caught
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the salesman, &ldquo;of course you
can, but the powder is, I repeat, fatal nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little while ago there was an illustrated paper presumedly
more fitted for the moral atmosphere of New York than
London.&nbsp; Its chief sale, before it was suppressed by the
law, was in the streets, where, with its doubtful engravings, it
was a bit of a nuisance.&nbsp; Of course, the sale of Evening
<i>Hechoes</i>, and <i>H</i>extra <i>Standards</i>, is a thing
one is obliged to put up with; nevertheless, one must often
regret that so useful a trade cannot be pushed in a quieter and
less ostentatious way.&nbsp; The ingenious youth, who devote
themselves to the sale of a paper especially devoted to the
interests of matrimony, <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>are a real nuisance.&nbsp; How they
pester many a lad that passes with their intimation that, by the
purchase of their trumpery paper, they can secure an heiress with
a thousand a year, as if such bargains were to be had any day,
whereas, the truth is, that they are rather scarce, and
that&mdash;whether with that sum or without&mdash;matrimony is a
very serious affair.&nbsp; Unprotected females have to suffer a
deal of impudence from these fellows.&nbsp; I saw a respectable,
decently-dressed, manifest old maid, exceedingly annoyed and
shocked by one of these fellows pursuing her half way up
Cheapside, with his shouts, &ldquo;Want a &rsquo;usband,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chance for you,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lots of &rsquo;usbands to be
had,&rdquo; and so on, in a way which she seemed to
feel&mdash;and I quite understood her feelings&mdash;was
singularly indelicate.&nbsp; What an insult to suppose that any
virtuous and accomplished lady is in seed of a husband, when she
has only <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>to raise a finger and she has, such is the chivalry of
the age, a score of adorers at her feet!</p>
<p>The newsboys are, of course, the most prominent of our street
salesmen, and they affect the City for many reasons.&nbsp; In the
first place, in and around the Mansion House there is a finer
opening for business than anywhere else; and in the second place,
a City business is often a very remunerative one.&nbsp; City men
who have made their thousands on the Stock Exchange or elsewhere
are not particular in the matter of change; and a fourpence or a
sixpence is often the reward of the lad who is the first to rush
up to a City swell as he leaves his office with a &ldquo;third
hedition of the <i>Hecho</i>&rdquo; or a special <i>Standard</i>
with some important telegram.&nbsp; In wet weather times go very
hard with these poor fellows.&nbsp; On the contrary, when it is
fine, business is brisk.&nbsp; They rely much on sensational
telegrams.&nbsp; <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>A war is a fine thing for them, and so is a case like
that of the Claimant, or a spicy divorce case, or an atrocious
murder.&nbsp; It is when such things as these occur that they
flourish, and that their joy is abounding.&nbsp; They must make a
good deal of money, but it goes as fast as it comes.&nbsp; An
attempt was made to establish a news-room for these boys, and
very nice premises were taken in Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane.&nbsp; The
coffee and bread and butter were excellent, and the arrangements
were all that could be desired.&nbsp; Nevertheless the
undertaking was a failure, because it was not supported by the
class for whose benefit it was especially intended.&nbsp; The
news-boys did not like the confinement, the regular hours, the
decent behaviour, the cleanliness and attention to little things
required.&nbsp; They wanted beer and &rsquo;baccy, and other
little amusements, more in accordance with their independent
position in fife.&nbsp; As a rule I <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>fancy they are honest; they
certainly never cheat a man if they think they will be found
out.&nbsp; I never had any difficulty in getting my change but
once, and then I was in an omnibus, and the chances were in the
boy&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; What is wonderful is that they do not
meet with more accidents.&nbsp; How they rush after omnibuses as
they urge on their wild career!&nbsp; Some of them are great
radicals.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allus reads <i>The Hecho</i> of a
Saturday,&rdquo; said one of them to me, &ldquo;to see how it
pitches into the haristocracy,&rdquo; when the articles signed
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Noblesse Oblige</span>&rdquo; were
being published.&nbsp; It is to be wondered at now and then that
their impertinence does not get them into grief.&nbsp; For
instance, to the young man who has any respect for the fair sex,
how disgusting to be told of women, good-looking, amiable and
accomplished, well-to-do, and apparently possessed of every
virtue under heaven, advertising for husbands.&nbsp; I suppose
<i>The Matrimonial </i><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span><i>News</i> is a success; but, if
so, certainly that is not a pleasant sign of the times.&nbsp; If
people will buy it, the newsboys are not to be blamed for hawking
it about.&nbsp; They take up what they think the public will
buy.&nbsp; Last year they were retailing &ldquo;The Devil,&rdquo;
price one penny, and this year they have taken up <i>Town
Talk</i>, and an ingenious puzzle, called, &ldquo;How to find out
Lord Beaconsfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wonder some of our publishers
of real good illustrated literature do not try to push the sale
of it in this way.&nbsp; I think it would pay.&nbsp; The public
would then have the bane and the antidote side by side.&nbsp; Mr.
Smithies might do much to increase the sale of <i>The British
Workman</i> if he had it hawked about the streets.</p>
<p>As to the costermongers, their name is legion; and that they
are a real service to the community must be evident to anyone who
sees what their prices are and what are those of the fruiterers
in the shops.&nbsp; They <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>bring fruit within the reach of the
community.&nbsp; In the summer-time we naturally require
fruit.&nbsp; It is good for grown-up men and women, it is good
for little children.&nbsp; In London they have no chance of
tasting it were it not for the costermonger who floods the
streets with all that is desirable in this respect; one day he
has West India pineapples for sale; another bananas or shaddocks;
another grapes, and apples, and pears, and apricots, and
greengages, and plums.&nbsp; One day he deals in strawberries and
another in cherries; and then, when the autumn comes on, what a
tempting display he makes of filberts, and walnuts, and
chestnuts!&nbsp; The amount of fruit thus poured in upon the
market, much of which would have perished had it not been sold
off at once, is really prodigious; and infinitely indebted to him
are the poor clerks who lay in a pennyworth of apples or pears as
they leave the office for the little ones at home.&nbsp; At one
<a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>time I
had a prejudice against these rough and noisy dealers; that
prejudice has vanished since I have taken to dining in the City
and indulging in &ldquo;a penny lot&rdquo; after dinner.&nbsp;
What I admire is the way in which they do up strawberries, and
cherries, and plums in little paper bags, which seem to contain
as much again as they really do.&nbsp; Occasionally a man gets
cheated, but that is when there is a woman in the case.</p>
<p>Oh, the flower-girls of the streets, what deceiving creatures
they are!&nbsp; It is not that, like the flower-girls of Paris,
they spoil a romance with pecuniary views, but it is that they
cheat you through thick and thin, and sell you camellias made of
turnips, and roses and azaleas equally fair to see and equally
false and vain.&nbsp; Can I ever forget my friend Dr. R. and the
little mishap that befell him when he assisted at a little
dinner&mdash;at which I had the honour to be a guest&mdash;given
by a Scotch poet to Scotch poets, and press-men, <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>and
barristers, in honour of the immortal Robert Burns?&nbsp;
Crossing by the Mansion House, in the dim light of a winter
evening, the doctor was accosted by a handsome lass, who offered
to sell him a camellia.&nbsp; The lady pressed her suit, and the
doctor fell.&nbsp; Granite in the discharge of duty, the doctor
has a soft place in his heart, and that woman finds out at
once.&nbsp; It is the old tale&mdash;the woman tempted and the
doctor gave way.&nbsp; As he came proud and smiling into the
drawing-room, the splendour of the doctor&rsquo;s camellia
arrested every eye.&nbsp; A near scrutiny was the result, and at
length the doctor had to confess that he had been the victim of
misplaced confidence in a London street flower-girl.</p>
<p>Then there are the men who deal in what they call pineapple
sweetmeat; their barrows are adorned with paintings representing
dimly the riches and luxuriance of the East.</p>
<p>Sunday brings with it its own peculiar <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>dealers and
trades.&nbsp; One of the sights of poor neighbourhoods is that of
a large barrel, painted red, on wheels.&nbsp; At the top is a
seat for the driver; at the other end there is a small shelf on
which are placed a tray of water and a row of glasses.&nbsp; Some
of these glasses look like porter with a head, and are retailed
at prices varying from a penny to twopence.&nbsp; Outside, in
great gilt letters, I read, &ldquo;The Great Blood
Purifier;&rdquo; then we have another line, &ldquo;Sarsaparilla,
Hilder, King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another line is
devoted to the announcement of &ldquo;Dandelion and Sarsaparilla
Pills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another intimates that sarsaparilla is the
&ldquo;Elixir of Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the back, the door over
the shelf contains a portrait of apparently a fine gay person,
female of course, who has received signal benefit from the ardour
with which she has swallowed the dandelion and sarsaparilla
pills; and around her, as witnesses and approvers of <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>such
conduct on her part, shines a row of stars.&nbsp; The salesman is
assisted by a small boy, who washes the glasses and places them
on the rack, and in other ways makes himself generally
useful.&nbsp; The salesman is by no means guilty of the trick of
underrating his wares.&nbsp; Accordingly, he lifts up his voice
like a trumpet as he deals out his pennyworths of the Elixir of
Life.&nbsp; In some cases he is familiar, in others
argumentative, in others bold as brass; and he gets a good many
customers.&nbsp; The race of fools who rush in where angels fear
to tread is by no means extinct.&nbsp; As I watched the poor
skinny quadruped, groggy and footsore, I felt how hard it was
that Sunday should shine no day of rest for him; but he had a
good deal more go in him than you would have imagined from his
appearance.&nbsp; All at once in the far distance appeared two
respected members of the City police; the gentleman with the
Elixir of Life closed his <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>door, jumped up into his seat,
pulled his small boy up after him, and was off like
lightening.&nbsp; This Arab steed could run after him.</p>

225</span>XII.&mdash;CITY NUISANCES.</h2>
<p>There are some people who are always grumbling.&nbsp; Hit them
high or hit them low, you can&rsquo;t please them.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think I belong to that class.&nbsp; I like to look on
the sunny side, remembering as the poet used to say when I was a
good deal younger than I am now&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis wiser, better far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the words of a still greater poet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I take the goods the gods provide me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if the lovely Thais sits beside me, provided she does not
lay a stress upon my <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>head and purse (I am a married man,
and the father of a family, and always hope to behave as such), I
don&rsquo;t object.&nbsp; He is not a wise man who quarrels with
his bread and butter; he is a fool who expects to find no thorns
amongst his roses.&nbsp; What I have gone through, dear
madam&mdash;for it is to the ladies I appeal&mdash;what I have
gone through, dear madam, is really astounding, at any rate to
myself.&nbsp; How I have survived at all is &ldquo;one of those
things no fellah can understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Repeatedly ruin has
stared me in the face.&nbsp; Repeatedly have my young affections
run to waste.&nbsp; Repeatedly have I been crossed in love, and
tramped up and down Cheapside and Fleet Street, a blighted
being.&nbsp; At this very moment, if I may trust to my medical
knowledge, I am now suffering from three distinct diseases, any
one of which is mortal; and yet if you were to meet me in the
street, or have a chat with me in a quiet caf&eacute; over a
cigar, <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>or sit next me at a City dinner, you would swear that I
was one of those old fogies whom nothing troubles, without nerves
or feelings, who vegetated rather than lived in the little
tragi-comedy we call life.&nbsp; It may be that little personal
details are uninteresting.&nbsp; I admit they are not matters of
transcendent importance.&nbsp; You do not need master them if you
are going up for your degree, or going in for a Civil Service
examination.&nbsp; I mention these merely to show that I can put
up with a good deal&mdash;that I am not easily put out of the
way; and that I should be one of the last persons in the world to
call anything a nuisance, unless it were really such.&nbsp; Under
these circumstances, I may claim a right to be heard; and, when I
state that I have no private aim, that, laying my hand upon my
heart, my only motive is the public good, I believe that I shall
not lift up my voice in vain.</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>Well,
to waste no more words about it, of the nuisances of London it
may be said their name is legion.&nbsp; In the first place, there
are the streets.&nbsp; If you get out at Farringdon Street
Station, and walk towards the Holborn Viaduct, it is of little
use your having had your boots cleaned that morning&mdash;a
little shower of rain, and the pavement is covered with
mud.&nbsp; This ought not to be.&nbsp; Let us take another
nuisance.&nbsp; All at once, as you walk along, you see a chimney
vomiting forth clouds of smoke.&nbsp; This is a great nuisance,
especially on a fine summer day, when the atmosphere of the City
may be said to be almost clear; and this nuisance is the more
unbearable as there is a law to put it down, which law is
actually to a certain extent carried out.&nbsp; Let anyone take
his stand on some spot where he can get a good view around him,
and he will be sure to see some chimney, in spite of the law,
darkening the sky and poisoning the <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>air.&nbsp; Then there is the
orange-peel, which has shortened many a valuable life, and
quenched the light of many a home.&nbsp; Then there is the
crowded traffic of the streets, which renders all locomotion
impossible, and keeps you sitting, angry and fuming, in a cab,
when it may be you are hurrying off to save a bill from being
dishonoured, to keep an appointment with a rich aunt or uncle
from whom you have great expectations, to have a last fond look
at someone whom you dearly love.&nbsp; As to the disputed points
as to the pavements, I have nothing to offer.&nbsp; To those who
have to live and sleep in the City, asphalte, I should say, must
be the greatest boon devised by the art of man.&nbsp; With
asphalte you may talk pleasantly to a friend in Cheapside, you
may get a reasonable night&rsquo;s sleep in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard, or you may crack a joke without bursting a
blood-vessel opposite the Mansion House itself.&nbsp; Be that as
it may, <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>as the question as to the comparative merits of
asphalte, or granite, or wood will be settled by wiser heads than
mine, I say no more; but what I complain of, and what is a
nuisance to everyone, is the perpetual tinkering and repairing
always going on in the streets, and the consequent blockade for a
time of certain important thoroughfares.&nbsp; What with the
drainage, and the water, and the gas pipes, and the telegraph
wires, there is in most of the City ways as much bustle almost
under the street as on it, and an ominous board with a notice
from the Lord Mayor turns aside a tremendous traffic, and is a
terrible nuisance as long as it lasts.&nbsp; Surely this waste of
time and annoyance is, a great deal of it, unnecessary.&nbsp; All
that is wanted is a little more contrivance and
forethought.&nbsp; I was once discussing the subject with a
leading City man and an M.P., as we were travelling <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>together in
a railway carriage on our way to a pleasant gathering of City
people many miles away beyond the sound of Bow Bells.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, with a suggestive wink, &ldquo;the
thing is easily explained; the rule is, for the surveyor&rsquo;s
son to marry the contractor&rsquo;s daughter, or something of
that sort, and so between them they manage to play into each
other&rsquo;s hands, and always have done so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
course the M.P. was joking.&nbsp; No one could conceive it
possible that our civic guardians, our common councilmen, our
aldermen, our City officers, would allow themselves to be imposed
on, and the public to be robbed in this way; but, alas! it is a
pity that there should be ground for such a joke, that it should
seem in any way to be founded on a fact.&nbsp; We are not so bad
as we were, I admit, but that is no reason why we should not be
better.&nbsp; Even now there are parts of <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>London to
which Gay&rsquo;s lines are applicable when he writes:</p>
<p>Though expedition bids, yet never stray<br />
Where no ranged post defends the rugged way;<br />
Here laden carts with thundering waggons meet,<br />
Wheels clash with wheels, and bar the narrow street,<br />
The lashing whip resounds, the horses strain,<br />
And blood in anguish bursts the swelling vein.</p>
<p>Something like this may be met with any day when the stones
are greasy on Fish Street Hill, as the waggons turn up from
Thames Street laden with the heavy merchandise of that quarter of
the town.&nbsp; As I have quoted Gay, let me give another
quotation from him.&nbsp; In one of his fables he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>How many saucy airs we meet<br />
From Temple Bar to Aldgate Street.<br />
Proud rogues who shared the South Sea prey,<br />
And spring like mushrooms in a day,<br />
They think it mean to condescend<br />
To know a brother or a friend.<br />
They blush to hear their mother&rsquo;s name,<br />
And by their pride expose their shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>There
are just such men as Gay wrote of to be met in our streets, and
they are a nuisance, but the law of libel, in the interest of
rogues who live by getting up bubble companies, is hard on the
press, and I prefer to quote Gay to making original remarks of my
own, remarks which may be true, which may be useful, but for
which the proprietor of any paper that would publish them would
have to pay heavily, at any rate in the way of costs.</p>
<p>Later in the day, one of the nuisances in the streets is
&ldquo;Those horrid boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have come home from
work, or school; they have had their tea, it is too early for
them to go to bed, their fathers and mothers don&rsquo;t know
what to do with them at home, and so they loiter about the
streets, and carry on their little games in them, much to their
own satisfaction, but very much to the annoyance of everyone
else.&nbsp; One of their favourite amusements is to run in
groups, <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>like so many wild Indians or a pack of wolves, howling
and shrieking in a way very alarming.&nbsp; It is no use talking
to them.&nbsp; It is no use putting the police on after
them.&nbsp; The belated citizen, on his way home to the
inevitable suburb, is frightened into fits ere he reaches his
much-hoped-for haven of rest.&nbsp; And the small shopkeepers in
the quiet streets&mdash;which they more especially
affect&mdash;in terror rush to the door, believing either that
there is a fire, or that Bedlam has broken loose, or that the
Fenians have come.&nbsp; In some parts, as in Whitechapel, the
wild girls of the streets are even worse.</p>
<p>There are many local nuisances in London; one of the chief of
these is the conduct of the watermen about the landing-places
near the Custom House.&nbsp; Females and foreigners, who have to
take boats to the large steamers lying in the river, are
frightfully plundered in this way.&nbsp; These men feel that they
can rob you with impunity, and they abuse their privileges.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said one, after he had squeezed a
five-shilling piece out of a poor foreigner for rowing him a few
yards, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put up with it this time, but
don&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; as if he, the boatman, and not
the poor foreigner, had been the victim of a most atrocious
fraud.&nbsp; Such fellows as these should be kept honest
somehow.&nbsp; Who does not recollect that chapter in
&ldquo;Vilette,&rdquo; in which Charlotte Bront&euml; has
recorded her waterside experiences?&nbsp; How she was landed by
the coachman in the midst of a throng of watermen, who gathered
around her like wolves; how she stepped at once into a boat,
desiring to be taken to the <i>Vivid</i>; how she was fleeced by
the waterman, as she paid an exorbitant sum, as the steward, a
young man, was looking over the ship&rsquo;s side, grinning a
smile in anticipation of the row there would have been had she
refused to pay.&nbsp; I had an experience somewhat similar
myself.&nbsp; Perhaps I got off easily.&nbsp; In <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>those dark
wharves on that black river, here and there lit by a distant and
dimly-burning lamp&mdash;at that midnight hour, when all good
people are in bed, it is well that there is nothing going on
worse than robbery in such a mild form.&nbsp; Had I been dropped
overboard, I am sure few people would have known it; and I am not
certain that I have no reason to be grateful to the lot amongst
whom I found myself that they attempted nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; Late at night there are many dark and lonely spots in
the City suggestive of dark deeds.&nbsp; In some one walks with
fear and trembling.&nbsp; Suspicious people have a knack of
turning up in such dark places; and the police can&rsquo;t be
everywhere.</p>
<p>Then there is the water supply.&nbsp; It is all very well to
have a spirited foreign policy abroad, but we do want a little
common sense at home; and the sanitary state of the nation is of
the first importance.&nbsp; You cannot <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>blame a man
that he refuses to drink bad water, and takes beer instead; and
if anything be clearer than another, it is that the water
supplied to the working man is bad; for whilst the rich man can
have his cisterns regularly cleaned out, and his water filtered,
the working man, as a rule, uses the water as he can get it, and
suffers in consequence, both in person and in pocket.&nbsp; Under
the influence of this state of things, it is not surprising to
find mothers refusing to allow their children to drink water on
the plea that it is bad for their health.&nbsp; Nor are these
mothers to be blamed.&nbsp; It is a fact that in England and
Wales alone upwards of eight hundred persons die every month from
typhoid fever; a disease which is now believed to be caused
almost entirely through drinking impure water.&nbsp; It is a fact
that in London we have little pure water to drink, the companies
are put to a great expense to filter their water, and yet <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>every week
we read such reports as the following from Dr. Frankland, the
official to whom is entrusted the analysing of such matters:
&ldquo;The Thames water, delivered by the West Middlesex,
Southwark, and Grand Junction Companies, was so much polluted by
organic matter as to be quite unfit for dietetic
purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other day I had to pay my water rates;
imagine my disgust at having to do so when the Government
inspector in the daily papers informed me that the water supplied
by the company was totally unfit for dietetic purposes!&nbsp; The
evil is no new one.&nbsp; It has been ventilated in every way;
and yet in London, the wealthiest city in the world, we cannot
get a cup of pure water.&nbsp; People can have it in Manchester
and Glasgow and New York; but in London&mdash;which claims to be
the capital of commerce, the seat of Legislation, the model
city&mdash;we have poison in the cup&mdash;as science tells us
that we cannot take <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>with impunity the living organisms
and fungoid growths with which London water more or less
abounds.&nbsp; Lately the working men met at Exeter Hall to say
that it was time to put a stop to this disgraceful state of
things.&nbsp; As Cardinal Manning said, if they wanted to give a
subject the slip, the proper way was to get a committee of
inquiry, and if they wanted to bury it altogether the right thing
to do was to have a Royal Commission.&nbsp; Action is what is
wanted.&nbsp; There are ten Parliamentary boroughs, and it was
proposed to hold public meetings in each of them, to form a
central committee, and thus to create a public pressure to which
Parliament would have to give way.&nbsp; As it is, as Sir Charles
Dilke pointed out, we have eight water companies in London who
have increased the cost of water all round without improving the
quality.&nbsp; What is to be asked is, that a body of men be
formed in London <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>to have the care of the water supply; and, as Mr. J.
Holms, M.P., pointed out, the sooner this is done the better, as
every year the companies&rsquo; properties increase in value, and
there will have to be paid to them additional compensation.&nbsp;
The importance of the subject was, perhaps, most pointedly
brought out by Dr. Lyon Playfair, who argued that, as in each
average individual there were 98 lb. of water to 40 lb. of flesh
and bone, he calculated that there were before him at that time
as many as 25,000 gallons of water; and if that water was impure
it must vitiate the blood and lower the health of all.&nbsp; We
must have, he said, a good supply of water, pure at the
source.&nbsp; We must have good receptacles for storing it, and
we must have a constant system of supply.</p>
<p>What great events from little causes spring!&nbsp; Last year a
gentleman was run over by a butcher&rsquo;s cart through the
careless driving of the butcher; and finding that <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>accidents
of that nature were of frequent occurrence and were increasing,
he, with other gentlemen, obtained a return of the number of
accidents from Sir Edmund Henderson, the chief of the
Metropolitan Police, which showed that, in 1878, 124 persons were
killed and 3,052 run over in the Metropolitan districts.&nbsp;
But this is not all.&nbsp; The return only showed such accidents
as came under the knowledge of the Metropolitan police.&nbsp;
Accordingly application was made to the Registrar-General of
Deaths, and from him it was ascertained that 237 persons were
killed by vehicles and 3,399 run over during that year in and
around London; and hence the formation of the society for the
prevention of street accidents.&nbsp; Further researches made by
the secretary among the London hospitals resulted in learning
that run-over cases formed the most common class of
accidents.&nbsp; The house surgeon of the principal hospital
wrote that <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>he computed there was an average of thirty
&ldquo;run-over&rdquo; cases a week brought there for treatment,
which, in that one hospital alone, would make 930 accidents
attended to there yearly.&nbsp; The result of the society&rsquo;s
operations are satisfactory.&nbsp; At any rate this year the
returns show one death less, and a falling off in run-over cases
to the number of 517.&nbsp; Such decrease the society claims to
be the result of its labours, on the ground that every year
during the last ten years has showed an increase of six per
cent.&nbsp; If this be so, it was well that the secretary was run
over, especially as apparently he was not much hurt by the
operation.&nbsp; Physically he is as fine a man as you would wish
to see; and though undoubtedly the sensation at the time was not
an agreeable one, yet, if it has led to the reduction of street
accidents, how much cause have we to rejoice.&nbsp; It seems
almost as if Mr. Buckle were right when he questions the
beneficial effect of morality on <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>national progress.&nbsp; At any
rate, if I were a lover of paradox I would quote Mandeville to
show how private vices become public benefits.&nbsp; A butcher
boy recklessly ran over Mr. Keevil, and the result is a decrease
of street accidents and mortality.&nbsp; Statues have been
erected to men who have less benefited the public than that
butcher boy.</p>
<p>But accidents will happen, and I fear, as the Lord Mayor truly
said at the first annual meeting of the society held in the
Egyptian Hall of the Mansion House, it is to be feared most of
them are really accidents, that is, things that cannot be
prevented.&nbsp; The society aims to prevent accidents by
enforcing existing laws; by petitioning Parliament to amend them;
by prosecuting offenders for furious driving; by granting
donations or loans to sufferers; by compulsory carriage of a lamp
on all vehicles, trimmed and lighted after sunset; by compulsory
use of brake-power; and by stationing the society&rsquo;s <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>mounted and
other officers in the leading thoroughfares of the metropolis,
and other towns, to check and pursue offenders, and to enforce
the claims of the society.&nbsp; At its first meeting we had an
array of elderly peers and distinguished persons, that was really
overpowering.&nbsp; One reverend speaker looked quite pathetic,
as, with an arm in a sling, he narrated how he had been the
victim of a street accident.&nbsp; Let it not be thought that I
am inclined to write of the reverend gentleman and the society
with levity.&nbsp; I, too, have suffered.&nbsp; The other night
in the fog, in a street-crossing, I experienced a disagreeable
sensation on the side of my head&mdash;which fortunately nature
has made thick enough for ordinary wear and tear&mdash;and in the
gloaming found that a cab had driven up against me.&nbsp;
Fortunately, I escaped with a slight contusion, but it would have
been a sad thing for my small home circle had it been a serious
matter.&nbsp; Alas! to men every <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>day accidents occur that are
serious; and there are women white with terror, and children
struck dumb with an undefined sense of impending ill, as the news
comes to them that the husband and father is in the
hospital.&nbsp; Sometimes the agony is prolonged, as they do not
even learn that; and who can tell the bitterness as the weary
hours of the night pass away and the cold gray of morn reappears,
as the watchful ear tries to fancy in every sound of the passing
footstep the return of one never to come home more?&nbsp; By all
means let us, if we can, prevent street accidents.&nbsp; Life is
not so bright, earth is not so full of joy, that we may neglect,
when an opportunity occurs, to save one breaking heart, to
prevent one solitary tear.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Helps, just before his death, published another of
his popular volumes, &ldquo;Friends in Council,&rdquo; in which
certain friends&mdash;men of the world and of high
position&mdash;are supposed to discuss the several <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>problems of
the day.&nbsp; The scene is laid in a villa on the banks of the
Thames.&nbsp; The host is Sir John Ellesmere&mdash;not Mr.
Milverton.&nbsp; The subject is &ldquo;Social Pressure,&rdquo; a
subject which may certainly be said to come home to our
businesses and bosoms.&nbsp; The aim of all the speeches is how
we are to be comfortable; and, as citizens of this great city, as
was to be expected, London occupies the chief place in their
thoughts, is referred to in all the arguments&mdash;in short,
points the moral and adorns the tale.&nbsp; Milverton reads an
essay on the subject, which lays it down as an indisputable truth
that one of the greatest evils of modern life is the existence of
great towns.&nbsp; The metropolis is pointed out as an
illustration.&nbsp; First we are told the loss of animal power is
enormous.&nbsp; Four or five hundred horses are carried to the
knacker&rsquo;s yard each week in London.&nbsp; After a
day&rsquo;s business it is a pleasure to take a walk in the
country; but, <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>it is asked, Who can do that in London, where there
are, in several directions, ten continuous miles of houses?&nbsp;
Then, as to the pleasures of society, these are destroyed by the
immense extent of the metropolis.&nbsp; Even the largest houses
are not, relatively speaking, large enough for the town in which
they are situated.&nbsp; As regards questions of health, Dr.
Arnott, whom Sir Arthur terms one of the greatest sanitary
reformers of the age, remarked that though London is a place
where the rate of mortality is not exceedingly high, yet it is a
place where nobody except butchers&rsquo; boys enjoy perfect
health&mdash;the full state of health that they are capable of
enjoying.</p>
<p>In spite of the somewhat extreme notions of the
&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; who seem to forget that men are driven
into cities by the necessity which compels most of them to earn
their daily bread, it must be admitted that in the question of
air they have hit a blot.&nbsp; The <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>first article of food, namely, fresh
air, is that which is least under the command of man.&nbsp; Mr.
Milverton says there is no danger of London being starved for
want of animal food.&nbsp; There is more and more danger every
year of its health being diminished from the want of a supply of
fresh air.&nbsp; It is stated, in confirmation of this fact, that
every year the hospital surgeons in London find it more difficult
to cure wounds and injuries of all kinds to the human body, on
account, it is supposed, of the growing impurity of the London
air.&nbsp; This bad air kills off the cows.&nbsp; A London cow
does not last a third part of the time one does in the
country.&nbsp; On this head much more might have been said.&nbsp;
The author might have referred to the mournful fate of the fine
cattle, who, recently, on the field of their triumph, the
Smithfield Club Show, found, not laurels and rewards, but a
grave, in consequence of the fog.&nbsp; We read that that famous
man, Count Rumford, used <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>to estimate the number of millions
of chaldrons of coals which were suspended in the atmosphere of
London, and to dwell upon the mischief which was caused to
furniture by the smoke when it descended.&nbsp; But there are
other special causes of injury, such as dust and chemical
emanations of all kinds.&nbsp; The result is that everything in
such a city as London soon loses all bloom and freshness, and,
indeed, is rapidly deteriorated.&nbsp; The more beautiful the
thing, the more swift and fatal is this deterioration.&nbsp; The
essayist calculates the injury of property in London, caused, not
by reasonable wear and tear, but by the result of the
agglomeration of too many people upon one spot of ground, as not
less than three or four millions of pounds per annum.&nbsp; It is
to be feared the estimate is not exaggerated.</p>
<p>There is a further illustration.&nbsp; Sir Rutherford Alcock,
as we all know, represented our interests in China.&nbsp; While
there <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>he
visited the Chinese Wall, and brought back two specimens from it
in the way of bricks.&nbsp; These bricks must have been many
centuries old, but they had kept their form and betrayed no signs
of decay in that atmosphere.&nbsp; Sir Rutherford put these two
bricks out in the balcony of his house in London.&nbsp; This was
about two years ago.&nbsp; One of these bricks has already gone
to pieces, being entirely disintegrated by the corrosive
influence of the London atmosphere.</p>
<p>In another way we also suffer.&nbsp; Certain kinds of
architecture are out of place in London, says our essayist:
&ldquo;All that is delicate and refined is so soon blurred,
defaced, and corroded by this cruel atmosphere, that it is a
mockery and a delusion to attempt fine work.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
ought to be a peculiar kind of architecture for such a
metropolis&mdash;large, coarse, and massive, owning neither
delicacy nor refinement, and not <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>admitting minute description of any
kind.&nbsp; And, again, that coarse work requires to be executed
in the hardest material, otherwise the corrosion is so great as
to cause the need for constant repair.</p>
<p>Another danger is pointed out in the following anecdote.&nbsp;
At a former time, when this country was threatened with an
invasion of cholera, the speaker (Milverton) was one of a
committee of persons appointed by Government supposed to have
some skill in sanitary science.&nbsp; &ldquo;We found,&rdquo; he
remarks, &ldquo;that a most deadly fever had originated from the
premises of one of the greatest vendors of oysters in the centre
of the metropolis.&nbsp; Attached to his premises there was a
large subterranean place where he deposited his oyster shells;
this place was connected with the sewers.&nbsp; The small portion
of animal matter left in the under shells became putrescent; and
from the huge mass of them that had accumulated in that <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>subterranean place there finally arose a stench of the
most horrible nature, which came up through all the neighbouring
gratings, and most probably into some of the neighbouring
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My readers need not be alarmed.&nbsp; Such a nuisance would
not be permitted now; and as oysters are getting dearer and
scarcer every day, it is to be questioned whether these shells
will be ever again in sufficient numbers as to form a putrid and
pernicious heap.&nbsp; But that the air is polluted by noxious
substances and trades is one of the greatest and most pressing
evils of the ever-threatening perils of such a Babylon as that in
which we live.&nbsp; We suggest, advisedly, the removal of all
noxious trades from London, in spite of all that the political
economists can say to the contrary.&nbsp; This, however, is of
course but a small part of the question.&nbsp; The main object is
to see what can be done to render <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>this vast agglomeration of animate
and inanimate beings less embarrassing and injurious.&nbsp; The
first thing that must occur to almost every mind is the necessity
for preserving open spaces, and even of creating them, a
necessity of which the Corporation of London is at any rate
aware.</p>
<p>There is more of novelty in the following: &ldquo;Another evil
of great towns is noise.&nbsp; There is the common proverb that
half the world does not know how the other half lives, which,
perhaps, would be a more effective saying if the word
&lsquo;suffers&rsquo; were substituted for
&lsquo;lives.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is probable that there is no form
of human suffering which meets with less sympathy or regard from
those who do not suffer from it, than the suffering caused by
noise.&nbsp; The man of hard, healthy, well-strung nerves can
scarcely imagine the real distress which men of sensitive nerves
endure from ill-regulated noise&mdash;how they literally quiver
and shiver <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>under it.&nbsp; Now, of course, the larger the town,
the more varied and the more abundant is the noise in it.&nbsp;
Even the domestic noises are dreadful to a man of acute nervous
sensibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the City we have done much to remove this evil.&nbsp; The
asphalte pavement has wrought wonders; the police have been also
efficacious in putting a stop to some of our roughest and most
discordant cries; and yet there is a volume of noise, ever rising
up and filling the air, which must shorten many a life, and which
must be a permanent source of misery.&nbsp; There are few of us
who have not realised what Sir Arthur Helps describes as the
terrors and horrors of ill-regulated noise, or have not wondered
that so much intellectual work is done so well as it is in these
great cities.&nbsp; Now that Sir Arthur has called attention to
the subject, it may be other people will think it worth
consideration.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>Damascus and Babylon are referred to for the purpose of
drawing a comparison to the disadvantage of London.&nbsp;
Babylon, we are told, had in its densest parts what is deficient
in London.&nbsp; Babylon contained within its walls land
sufficient for agricultural purposes, to enable the inhabitants
of the city to be fed by those resources during a siege.&nbsp;
Well, of course, that is quite out of question as regards
London.&nbsp; Then comes Damascus, which, &ldquo;from the
presence of large gardens, forms a most pleasing contrast to
London and other large cities;&rdquo; but Damascus has the
plague, and that London, with all its magnitude, escapes.&nbsp;
Then we are told London is built so badly that were it to be
abandoned by its population it would fall during that time into a
state of ruin which would astonish the world.&nbsp; This, it is
to be feared, is true of the suburbs, where builders are allowed
to scamp their work just as they please, but <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>certainly
cannot be said of the City, where there is proper superintendence
and most vigilant care.&nbsp; Another evil to which the
&ldquo;Friends&rdquo; refer, is the absence of raised buildings,
partially covered in, which should enable those in the
neighbourhood to take exercise with freedom both from bitter
winds and driving rains; in fact, an elevated kind of
cloister&mdash;where it is suggested recreation and amusement
might be provided, especially of a musical kind.&nbsp; It is to
be feared space is too valuable for this in the City; and, until
our roughs are educated under the new School Board, we know no
part of the metropolis where such a thing is practicable, even
though, as hinted, the attractions of such a place would
counteract those of the gin palace.&nbsp; There was a Piazza in
Regent Street, which was removed on account of the shelter it
gave to improper characters.&nbsp; One suggestion is made, which
is really <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>practicable, and which would be a great boon to
Londoners.&nbsp; Ellesmere wishes that he were a Lord of the
Woods and Forests, as, if he were, he would add to Kew Gardens
the eight hundred acres now lying waste between them and
Richmond; he wants a vegetable-garden there, and a
recreation-ground for the people, and the ground, he argues, is
admirably adapted for such purposes.</p>
<p>Ah! these poor Londoners.&nbsp; They fare but poorly at the
hands of the &ldquo;Council.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hail a cab in
any part of London where there is a large stream of passers-by,
you will observe that several grown-up persons and a large number
of boys will stop to see you get in the cab.&nbsp; That very
commonplace transaction has some charm for them&mdash;their days
being passed in such continuous dulness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, says
one speaker: &ldquo;At Dresden or Munich, on their holidays, the
whole population flock out to some beautiful <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>garden a
mile or two from the town, hear good music, imbibe fresh air, and
spend only a few pence in those humble but complete
pleasures;&rdquo; and then this picture is contrasted with that
of the head of the family here, who spends his holiday at the
neighbouring gin-palace round the corner.&nbsp; Certainly this is
a very unfair comparison, as anyone knows who visits our public
gardens and parks and health resorts on the occasion of a
national holiday.&nbsp; There is another picture, which it is to
be feared is more common.&nbsp; It tells of a sanitary reformer
who noticed how a young woman who had come from the country and
was living in some miserable city-court or alley, made, for a
time, great efforts to keep that court or alley clean.&nbsp; But
gradually, day by day, the efforts of that poor woman were less
and less vigorous, until in a few weeks she became accustomed to
and contented with the state of squalor which surrounded her, <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>and made no
effort to remove it.&nbsp; It is true, as Milverton remarks:
&ldquo;We in London subside into living contentedly amidst dirt,
and seeing our books, our pictures, our other works of art, and
our furniture become daily more dirty, dusty, and
degenerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our grandfathers lived in the City, and were glad to do
so.&nbsp; It is a pity one has to waste so much time travelling
backward and forward between one&rsquo;s shop and country house,
and office and one&rsquo;s home, but if you can&rsquo;t get fresh
air in the City&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t rear children in its
atmosphere&mdash;if its soot is fatal to your health&mdash;if its
fogs carry one off to a premature grave&mdash;if its noises wear
out your nerves&mdash;one has no alternative.&nbsp; Is it a dream
to look forward to a time when beggars and rogues shall disappear
from its streets&mdash;when it shall be the home of a peaceful,
virtuous, and enlightened community&mdash;when in the summer-time
as you look up you will be able to see the sun&mdash;<a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>when you
will be able to drink pure water&mdash;when, within the sound of
Bow Bells, you shall be able to live to a good old age&mdash;and
when, on the Sabbath, its churches and chapels, now empty of
worshippers, shall be filled with devout men and women?&nbsp; Or
is it to go on daily becoming more gorgeous to the eye and more
desolate to the heart?&nbsp; Alas! it seems nothing but a deluge
can save the City, and as much now as ever the wearied citizen
will have to sing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, well may poets make a fuss<br />
In summer time, and sigh <i>O rus</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And ask,</p>
<blockquote><p>What joy have I in June&rsquo;s return?<br />
My feet are parched; my eyeballs burn;<br />
I scent no flowery gust.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But faint the flagging Zephyr springs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With dry Macadam on its wings,<br />
And turns me dust to dust.</p>
</blockquote>

261</span>XIII.&mdash;OUT OF GAOL.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I wait to bring you back, sir?&rdquo; said a
cabman to me the other morning, as he landed me at an early hour
before the gloomy pile, which has hitherto been known as the
Middlesex House of Correction, placed, as my readers may know
well, on Mount Pleasant, just out of Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road.&nbsp;
On a dull, dreary morning, it is anything but pleasant, that
Mount, in spite of its name, and yet I dismissed the cabman and
got out into the street, not to enjoy the view, or to inhale the
raw fog, which threw a misty gloom over everything, nor even to
admire the architecture of the substantial plain <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>brick-wall-order of the building, which, erected in
1794, and greatly enlarged since, occupies no less than nine
acres, and was devoted to the maintenance of a thousand male
persons belonging to the small but thickly-inhabited county of
Middlesex.&nbsp; Government, in its wisdom, has altered all that,
and it is not exactly clear to what purposes the Middlesex House
of Correction will be applied in the future, or to whom it will
belong.&nbsp; Imperialism requires centralisation, and thus it is
local government gradually disappears.</p>
<p>But I am not standing out here in the raw gloomy November
morning to write a political disquisition which few will read,
and which they will forget the next minute, but I am come to see
the prisoners released from gaol.&nbsp; There is a little mob
outside, who stand close, apparently to keep each other warm, and
who regard me evidently with not a little suspicion as I light up
a cigar to <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>keep the cold out and prepare for the worst.&nbsp;
Every now and then a &ldquo;Favourite&rdquo; omnibus rumbles past
with its load of clerks and warehousemen to their places of
business, while a perpetual stream of pedestrians, aiming at the
same destination, passes on.&nbsp; Evidently, they regard us with
pity, and one sees that in the casual glance, even if there be no
language escaping from the lips.&nbsp; It does not seem to me
that we are a very showy lot.&nbsp; A little way off a dark and
dingy brougham drives up as if it were ashamed of the job and
only put in an appearance under protest, as it were; but all
around me are wretchedly poor, and chiefly of the costermonger
class, whose language is more expressive than refined.&nbsp;
There are sorrowful women in the group&mdash;mothers who have
come for sons who have been, not to put too fine a point on it,
unfortunate; wives with babies in their arms, perhaps born since
the husband was in &ldquo;trouble,&rdquo; <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>and sisters
who wait to take their brothers where they can have something
better than prison fare and a lighter life than that which exists
within the four walls of a prison.&nbsp; Some of the women are to
be pitied&mdash;one, in a widow&rsquo;s garb, with a tear-stained
face, particularly attracts my attention.&nbsp; She has brought
all her family with her as she comes to take back from the hands
of justice her erring son, who, let us hope, may yet live to be a
comfort to the poor mother, who evidently needs it so much; and
who, perhaps, reproaches herself that she has been a little to
blame in the matter.&nbsp; It is hard work to train up young
ones, whether they be rich or poor; but the children of the
latter in the filthy lodging-houses in low districts have little,
alas! to lead them right, and much in the way of precept and
example to lead them wrong.&nbsp; With Board schools to teach
honesty is the best policy, we may expect better things in <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>the days to
come; and, if that be done, I feel certain the Board will have
deserved well of the country; if it fails in imparting that
higher instruction which some of its leading members seem to
think the one thing needful, and to be gained for the poor
man&rsquo;s child at any cost to the unfortunate ratepayer of the
class immediately above.&nbsp; But this is a digression&mdash;and
it only helps to pass away the time which here this cold, raw
morning appears to have quite forgotten to fly.&nbsp; It seems to
me an age since I heard the neighbouring chimes indicate that it
was a quarter to nine, and now at length they strike nine, and
still the big gates are closed, and we are silent with
expectation&mdash;as if, at least, we expected the arrival of a
Lord Mayor or a Prince of Wales.&nbsp; A few policemen have now
come up to keep the crowd back, whilst a quiet, respectable,
unassuming individual comes to the gate, ready to give each
prisoner a ticket to a little <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>breakfast in a Mission Hall close
by.&nbsp; Mr. Wheatley, the individual referred to, has his heart
in the work, and I see he has friends and assistants in the
crowd, such as Mr. Hatton, of the Mission Hall in Wylde Street,
and others.&nbsp; In a few minutes they will be hard at work, for
the big gates suddenly are wide apart, and a couple of lads
appear with a smile on their pale countenances, for they are
free.&nbsp; Face to face with the crowd outside they seem a
little amazed, and scarce know which way to turn.&nbsp; Mr.
Wheatley gives them a card of invitation, and Mr. Hatton and his
friends outside follow it up with pressing remarks, which lead
them to march off to a neighbouring Mission Hall.&nbsp; Again the
doors are closed, and we are silent.&nbsp; Then the gates fly
apart, and out come two or three more, who seem to wish to slink
away without being remarked by anyone.&nbsp; However, a little
pale-faced girl cries, &ldquo;Charley!&rdquo; in a soft trembling
voice, <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>and Charley looks, and as the girl leaves the rank he
takes her hand, and goes his way rejoicing.&nbsp; A big
bullet-headed fellow has no cap as he comes out, and a friend in
the crowd chucks him one, which he puts on his head, and is soon
lost to sight.&nbsp; Another one appears at the gate, and a pal
comes up to him, and offers him a pipe, which he straightway
begins to smoke, with a gusto easier imagined than
described.&nbsp; One old man as he hobbles out refuses the
proffered card, saying that he was quite wicked enough, and did
not want none of that.&nbsp; Evidently he is a hardened sinner,
and I fear the chaplain has found him rather a bad subject.&nbsp;
One man, a bit of a wag, creates a laugh, as, looking at the
women in the crowd, he calls out, &ldquo;Come along, my
dears,&rdquo; and away he goes to his own place.</p>
<p>Again there is another pause, and then a respectable-looking
man makes his appearance.&nbsp; Suddenly his wife clasps his
hand, <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>and leads him off.&nbsp; There is irrepressible emotion
in her face, though she does not say a word, nor he either.&nbsp;
It does not seem to me that he is a hardened criminal, and he may
yet retrieve the blot on his character.&nbsp; Order again
prevails, and a voice out of the middle of the gate asks if
anyone is waiting for Jones and Robinson.&nbsp; That means Jones
and Robinson have behaved well&mdash;have earned a little money,
which is to be handed over to their friends.&nbsp; And thus half
an hour passes away, and as I look at the crowd I see that it has
partly changed, and is composed more of casual street boys and
pedestrians who have stopped to look.&nbsp; I miss almost all the
women who were there an hour ago, and most of the costermonger
class have disappeared, though a few still linger on.&nbsp; The
voice from the closed doors says that there are no more to come
out to-day, and slowly the crowd melts away.&nbsp; Some are
evidently sad.&nbsp; They had expected <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>a father, a
brother, a husband, and now they have to wait awhile.&nbsp; On
our right, as we make our way to Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, there is
a little Mission Hall, and I turn in.&nbsp; Already the place is
full, and as the gas falls on their faces as they devour the
morning meal provided for them by Mr. Hatton and his friends, it
seems to me that I never saw a more ill-favoured lot.&nbsp; There
was not a pleasant face among them&mdash;not a man or a lad that
I would have cared to set to work in my garden or house; and as
to their poverty, that was indescribable.&nbsp; These are the men
whom none had come to meet&mdash;the waifs and strays, without
money or friends or work, with that defiant scowl which denotes
how low the man has sunk, and how little it matters to him
whether he spend his days in the workhouse or the gaol.&nbsp; Mr.
Wheatley talks kindly to them, and after singing&mdash;not by
them, for they all sit glum and silent&mdash;Mr. Hatton prays,
and the meeting is <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>over.&nbsp; A good many then come forward to sign the
pledge, and I leave them as they explain their position and their
need.&nbsp; I see Mr. Wheatley gives a few a trifle; but a
trifle, alas! won&rsquo;t keep a man in London long out of
gaol.</p>
<h2><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>XIV.&mdash;IN A GIPSY CAMP.</h2>
<p>The other day I was witness to a spectacle which made me feel
a doubt as to whether I was living in the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; I was, as it were, within the shadow of that
mighty London where Royalty resides; where the richest Church in
Christendom rejoices in its abbey and cathedral, and its hundreds
of churches; where an enlightened and energetic Dissent has not
only planted its temples in every district, but has sent forth
its missionary agents into every land; where the fierce light of
public opinion, aided by a press which never slumbers, is a
terror to them that do evil, and a praise to them that <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>do well; a
city which we love to boast heads the onward march of man; and
yet the scene before me was as intensely that of savage life as
if I had been in a Zulu kraal, and savage life destitute of all
that lends it picturesque attractions or ideal charms.&nbsp; I
was standing in the midst of some twenty tents and vans,
inhabited by that wandering race of whose origin we know so
little, and of whose future we know less.&nbsp; The snow was on
the ground, there was frost in the very air.&nbsp; Within a few
yards was a great Board school; close by were factories and
workshops, and the other concomitants of organised industrial
life.&nbsp; Yet in that small area the gipsies held undisputed
sway.&nbsp; In or about London there are, it is calculated, some
two thousand of these dwellers in tents.&nbsp; In all England
there are some twenty thousand of these sons of Ishmael, with
hands against everyone, or, perhaps, to put it more truly, with
everyone&rsquo;s hands against them.&nbsp; <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>In
summer-time their lot is by no means to be envied; in winter
their state is deplorable indeed.</p>
<p>We entered, Mr. George Smith and I, and were received as
friends.&nbsp; Had I gone by myself I question whether my
reception would have been a pleasant one.&nbsp; As gipsies pay no
taxes they can keep any number of dogs, and these dogs have a way
of sniffing and snarling anything but agreeable to an unbidden
guest.&nbsp; The poor people complained to me that no one ever
came to see them.&nbsp; I should be surprised if anyone did; but
Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, is no common man; and having
secured fair-play for the poor children of the
brick-fields&mdash;he himself was brought up in a
brick-yard&mdash;and for the poor and sadly-neglected inmates of
the canal boats, he has now turned his attention to the
gipsies.&nbsp; His idea is&mdash;and it is a good one&mdash;that
an Act of Parliament should be passed for their benefit,
something similar to <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>that he has been the means of
carrying for the canal and brick-field children.&nbsp; In a paper
read before the Social Science Congress at Manchester, Mr. Smith
argued that all tents, shows, caravans, auctioneer vans, and like
places, used as dwellings, should be registered and numbered, and
under proper sanitary arrangements, with sanitary inspectors and
School Board officers in every town and village.&nbsp; Thus in
every district the children would have their names and attendance
registered in a book, which they could take with them from place
to place, and, when endorsed by the schoolmaster, it would show
that the children were attending school.&nbsp; In carrying out
this idea, it is a pity that Mr. Smith should have to bear all
the burden.&nbsp; As it is, he has suffered greatly in his pocket
by his philanthropic effort.&nbsp; At one time he had a well-paid
situation, which he had to relinquish, as he declined to keep
silence when the wrongs of the children of <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>the
brick-yards were to be proclaimed and redressed.&nbsp; He not
only did this, but he parted with what little property he had
rather than the battle should be lost; and I am glad to see that
a George Smith Fund has been formed, of which Lord Aberdeen is
chairman; and as Mr. Smith is now without business or occupation,
or means of livelihood, if I had five pounds to
spare&mdash;which, alas! I have not&mdash;I know where it would
go.&nbsp; As to the gipsies, they evidently hail Mr. Smith as a
friend in need and a friend indeed.</p>
<p>It is no joke, going into a gipsy yard, and it is still less
so when you go down on your hands and knees and crawl into the
gipsy&rsquo;s wigwam; but the worst of it is, when you have done
so there is little to see after all.&nbsp; In the middle, on a
few bricks, is a stove or fireplace of some kind.&nbsp; On the
ground is a floor of wood-chips, or straw, or shavings, and on
this squat some two or three big, <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>burly men, who make linen-pegs and
skewers, and mend chairs and various articles, the tribe, as they
wander along, seek to sell.&nbsp; The women are away, for it is
they who bring the grist to the mill, as they tell fortunes, or
sell their wares, or follow their doubtful trade; but the place
swarms with children, and it was wonderful to see with what
avidity they stretched out the dirtiest little hand imaginable as
Mr. Smith prepared to distribute some sweets he had brought with
him for that purpose.&nbsp; As we entered, all the vans were shut
up, and the tents only were occupied, the vans being apparently
deserted; but presently a door was opened half-way, and out
popped a little gipsy head, with sparkling eyes and curly hair;
and then another door opened, and a similar spectacle was to be
seen.&nbsp; Let us look into the van, about the size of a tiny
cabin, and chock full, in the first place, with a cooking-stove;
and then with shelves, with <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>curtains, and some kind of bedding,
apparently not very clean, on which the family repose.&nbsp; It
is a piteous life, even at the best, in that van; even when the
cooking-pot is filled with something more savoury than cabbages
or potatoes, the usual fare; but the children seem happy,
nevertheless, in their dirty rags, and with their luxurious heads
of curly hair.&nbsp; All of them are as ignorant as Hottentots,
and lead a life horrible to think of.&nbsp; I only saw one woman
in the camp, and I only saw her by uncovering the top and looking
into the tent in which she resides.&nbsp; She is terribly poor,
she says, and pleads earnestly for a few coppers; and I can well
believe she wants them, for in this England of ours, and
especially in the outskirts of London, the gipsy is not a little
out of place.&nbsp; Around us are some strapping girls, one with
a wonderfully sweet smile on her face, who, if they could be
trained to domestic service, would have a far happier life than
they can ever <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>hope to lead.&nbsp; The cold and wet seem to affect
them not, nor the poor diet, nor the smoke and bad air of their
cabins, in which they crowd, while the men lazily work, and the
mothers are far away.&nbsp; The leading lady in this camp is
absent on business; but she is a firm adherent of Mr. George
Smith, and wishes to see the children educated; and as she is a
Lee, and Lee in gipsy annals takes the same rank as a Norfolk
Howard in aristocratic circles, that says a good deal; but then,
if you educate a gipsy girl, she will want to have her hands and
face, at any rate, clean; and a gipsy boy, when he learns to
read, will feel that he is born for a nobler end than to dwell in
a stinking wigwam, to lead a lawless life, to herd with
questionable characters, and to pick up a precarious existence at
fairs and races; and our poets and novelists and artists will not
like that.&nbsp; However, just now, by means of letters in the
newspapers, and engravings <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>in the illustrated journals, a good
deal of attention is paid to the gipsies, and if they can be
reclaimed and turned into decent men and women, a good many
farmers&rsquo; wives will sleep comfortably at night, especially
when geese and turkeys are being fattened for Christmas fare; and
a desirable impulse will be given to the trade in soap.</p>
<h2><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>XV.&mdash;THE STREET BOYS OF LONDON.</h2>
<p>One of the comic sights of the City is that of a guardian of
the streets making an attack upon a bevy of small boys, who are
enjoying themselves in their own wild way in some quiet corner
sacred to the pursuits of trade.&nbsp; It may be that the ragged
urchins are pretending to be engaged in business, but X. Y. Z.
knows better, and, remembering that order is heaven&rsquo;s first
law, and that the aim of all good men and true is to make London
as much as possible like the New Jerusalem, he dashes in amongst
the chaotic mob in the vain hope that he shall be able to send <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>them about
their business.&nbsp; Alas! London in one respect resembles a
place not mentioned in ears polite, in that it is paved with good
intentions.&nbsp; X. Y. Z. is a case in point.&nbsp; In a fair
field the chances would be in his favour.&nbsp; He has long legs,
he is well made, he has more than an average amount of bone and
muscle, but he is not fairly matched.&nbsp; Indeed, he is as much
out of his element in the contest as a bull in a china
shop.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t dodge under horses&rsquo; bellies; he
can&rsquo;t crawl between the wheels of an omnibus or railway
waggon; he can&rsquo;t hide his portly form behind a letter
pillar; and his pursuit is as vain as that of a butterfly by a
buffalo; and generally he does but put to rout the juvenile mob,
and resolve it into its component parts only for a time.&nbsp; It
is not always so.&nbsp; A. B. C. comes to the aid of X. Y. Z.,
and captures the small boy, who, to avoid Charybdis, falls a prey
to Scylla, and then the precious prize is borne away before <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>the bench,
and Old Jewry rejoices, for there is one little pest the
less.&nbsp; Of course the policeman is right.&nbsp; He does what
I could not do.&nbsp; I am not a millionaire, but it would
require a very handsome sum to get me to go boy-hunting down
Cheapside or in any of its adjacent streets.&nbsp; X. Y. Z. has
less sense of incongruity than I have, or he sees the eternal
fitness of things from a different point of view.&nbsp; Let me
observe here the boy has also a standpoint differing from
either.</p>
<p>Let me take a single case.&nbsp; Jack Smith, as we will call
him, was the son of a Scotch piper.&nbsp; He was born&mdash;or he
has heard his mother say so&mdash;in one of the vast number of
the courts that lead out of the Strand.&nbsp; His father was in
the army, but on his discharge took to playing in the streets and
in public-houses for his living till his death a few years
back.&nbsp; As to his mother&mdash;hear this, ye sentimentalists
who say pretty things <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>about a mother&rsquo;s
love!&mdash;she deserted the boy, and left him to shift for
himself.&nbsp; He took, of course, to selling lights and
newspapers.&nbsp; When he got money he lodged in the Mint, when
he had not, he slept in the barges off Thames Street.&nbsp; At
last one morning he was caught by a policeman, and hauled before
the Lord Mayor.&nbsp; The latter let him off that time, but
warned the boy that if he were caught again it would be the duty
of society to send him to gaol.&nbsp; What can such a boy think
of society?&nbsp; Will he be very grateful for its kindness, or
very anxious for its welfare?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; London, it
is calculated, contains ten thousand of these shoeless, homeless,
friendless, forsaken, ragged, unwashed, uncombed young urchins of
doubtful antecedents.&nbsp; It is difficult to trace their
genealogies, and it is still more difficult to understand why
they ever came into existence at all.&nbsp; They are not a
blessing either to father or mother, <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>and as a rule may be said to deny
the existence of parental authority altogether.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother dead; father gone for a soldier&mdash;a
sailor&rdquo;&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;is the common result
of all inquiry; and, when it is not so, when father and mother do
&ldquo;turn up&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;turn up&rdquo; from the
nearest gin-shop, all redolent of its perfume&mdash;it is not
always to the boy&rsquo;s advantage.&nbsp; Solomon says,
&ldquo;Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;&rdquo; he
might have said the same of many who are not children; and what
is to be expected of a boy who is born and bred, as it were, in
the streets of London?&nbsp; I have known wise fathers have
foolish sons.&nbsp; I have seen the children of what are called
pious people go astray.&nbsp; In the very city of London many are
the ministers&rsquo; and clergymen&rsquo;s sons who kick over the
traces.&nbsp; The crop of wild oats sown by some of these young
fellows is really astonishing.&nbsp; It was only the other day
that the son of the foremost <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>baronet in Evangelical circles, the
last scion as it were of a noble house, stood trembling at the
bar of the Old Bailey.&nbsp; But these children of the gutter
have never had a chance of going right.&nbsp; No mother has
watched their every step&mdash;no father has held up to them a
living example of truth and integrity and right&mdash;no teacher
has waited the dawning of their young intellect&mdash;no
Christian minister has moulded and guided the workings of their
young hearts&mdash;the atmosphere in which they live and move and
have their being as of poverty and crime.&nbsp; Mostly they run
away from home, the home of the thief and the harlot and the
drunkard, and what they learn they learn in the back streets of
Whitechapel, in the filthy courts of Drury Lane, in the purlieus
of St. Giles.&nbsp; Like perpetuates its like.&nbsp; The seed of
the serpent is always venomous; the tiger&rsquo;s cub is always
thirsting for blood.&nbsp; There are <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>gutter children in London who have
risen to be merchant princes, but they have come of an honest
good family stock.&nbsp; As to those of whom I write, there is a
curse on them from their very birth.&nbsp; Happily for them, they
are unconscious of it, and yet in some undefined way it treads
upon their steps.&nbsp; Like Gray&rsquo;s naughty schoolboys:</p>
<blockquote><p>They hear a voice in every wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And catch a fearful joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I say, they are secretly conscious of a war between
themselves and all that is deemed respectable.&nbsp; They feel
that society, in the shape of the policeman, has its eye upon
them.&nbsp; They have very restless eyes and very restless
legs.&nbsp; They are as unlike the primitive ploughboy of the fat
fields of Suffolk, of the swamps of Essex, of the fens of
Lincolnshire, of the Sussex Downs, as can well be imagined.&nbsp;
You can scarcely fancy they belong to the same species; yet, at
the <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>same
time, the street boy of the city is the same all the world
over.&nbsp; In Paris, in London, in Edinburgh, in Dublin, and
Belfast, the dirty little ragged rascals are intrinsically one
and the same&mdash;barring the speech.&nbsp; It is wonderful this
oneness of sentiment, the bonds of brotherhood.&nbsp; The other
day, on the pier at Boulogne, I lit a fusee for the purpose of
having a smoke.&nbsp; Before I could say Jack Robinson, I was
beset with hordes of ragged, shoeless, unwashed urchins, just the
same as those you see in Cheapside; and it was only by bribery
and corruption that I could emancipate myself.&nbsp; In London,
as is to be expected, we have more of the commercial element;
there is less freedom for them here.&nbsp; They must turn
traders, and hawk <i>Echos</i> and cigar-lights, or sweep
crossings.&nbsp; As to miscellaneous and irregular talent,
society fosters it no more in the ragged boy than it does in the
well-clad man, and so we have <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>got rid of the Catherine-wheel
business and dangerous gymnastics of that kind.&nbsp; Many boys
have the vices of their breed&mdash;the vices engendered by a
life of poverty and of fear.&nbsp; They are afraid to be honest
in their answers.&nbsp; They are afraid, when you talk to them,
you have got some end in view.&nbsp; They will watch you, when
you question them, to see how they can best please you.&nbsp; If
you want to see what they are, catch them flattening their noses
against the eating-house shop windows just about pudding
time.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s human nature, and a wonderful thing is
human nature.&nbsp; It would be well if society would take the
trouble to recognise that fact.&nbsp; It was the want of the
recognition of that fact in the good old times, when wild
lawlessness was tempered with Draconian severity, that has
entailed on the present generation the difficult problem as to
what is to be done with our street boys.</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>Two
solutions of the problem are offered us&mdash;the Reformatory
School and the Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children.&nbsp;
According to our statisticians, in the former seventy per cent.
are reclaimed and reformed.&nbsp; According to the latter, eighty
per cent. are similarly improved.&nbsp; Mr. Williams, of Great
Queen Street, claims for his institutions that they have an
advantage over the reformatories, inasmuch as the taint of a
prison attaches to the former; and that the fact of a boy having
been an inmate of one of them exerts very often a most
unfavourable influence over his prospects in life, however
desirous he may be of acting honestly and industriously.&nbsp;
For years and years he becomes marked, and is treated with more
or less suspicion; and, when this is the case, it is not to be
wondered at if he returns to a life in which the standard of
action is very different to that of good society, and in which
the most successful criminals are the <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>most highly envied and
applauded.&nbsp; The returns of the Great Queen Street Refuge
show, however, much may be done to cure the evils arising from
suffering the street boys of our day to ripen under the
devil&rsquo;s guidance into depravity and crime.&nbsp; Last year,
there were admitted there 445 boys, as follows: From various
casual wards and other night-shelters, 63; on the application of
parties interested in their welfare, 95; on their own
application, 98; sent in by the secretary and subscribers from
the street, 76; brought in by the boys&rsquo; beadle (that is, a
person employed to hunt up needy cases), 17; sent by magistrates
and policemen, as being utterly destitute, 17; sent by London
City missionaries, ragged-school teachers, and others, 44;
readmitted from the ship, 60; sent from Newsboys&rsquo; Home,
29.&nbsp; The benefit of such an agency is still more apparent
when we remember that it is <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>not much more than five years since
the <i>Chichester</i> training-ship has been established, and
that during that time, upwards of one thousand boys have been
placed on board, and in little more than four years and a half
the committee have trained and placed out in the Mercantile
Marine and Royal Navy as many as seven hundred boys, all of whom,
it is to be remembered, were bound to be, from necessity, as it
were, the criminal classes of society.&nbsp; But, after all, this
is but a drop in the bucket.&nbsp; It is something to do; it is a
great deal to do.&nbsp; England requires good sailor lads; and
these lads generally, according to the testimony of their
masters, turn out such.&nbsp; At Farningham, the secretary, Mr.
A. O. Charles, will show you any day three hundred street arabs
all growing respectable.&nbsp; England is already overstocked
with incapables and scoundrels; and these boys would have <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>been such
had not kindly hearts and friendly hands come to the
rescue.&nbsp; That they can be trained and made useful we see in
the number of well-conducted blacking boys, of whom, I believe,
the number is three hundred and sixty-two, and in the little
scavengers who pursue their calling almost at the very peril of
their life.&nbsp; In 1851 the first Shoe-black Society was
formed.&nbsp; There are now eight, and last year the earnings of
the boys amounted to upwards of &pound;11,000.&nbsp; Only think
of all this money made by London mud!</p>
<p>Clearly the street boy can be elevated in the scale of
being.&nbsp; The vices of his early life may be eradicated.&nbsp;
The better part of him may be strengthened and called into
existence.&nbsp; He is not all bad, nor altogether
incurable.&nbsp; He is what you and I might have been, good or
bad, had we been left to ourselves.&nbsp; It is hard work winning
him <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>over.&nbsp; It requires a patience and a wisdom such as
only a few possess, but it can be done, and it must be done, if
the future of our country is to be brighter and better than its
past.&nbsp; Ah, he is very human, that little unwashed, uncombed,
unfed, untended nobody&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; Leave him alone, and
he will be cunning as a serpent, cruel as a wolf, like a roaring
lion, ever hungering for its prey.&nbsp; Grown up to a man, and
not hung, he will cost the State a great deal of money, for no
man wastes property like the thief, and to try him and shut him
in prison is very costly work.&nbsp; It is infinitely cheaper to
make an honest man of him.&nbsp; For ten pounds you may plant him
with a Canadian settler, who will make a man of him, in a very
few years.&nbsp; At any rate it is unwise to treat him unkindly,
to keep him moving on, to chivy him for ever along the streets,
much to the disgust of old ladies, who are <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>always
&ldquo;dratting&rdquo; those horrid boys.&nbsp; It is to be
feared their number is on the increase, and this, I regret to
write, is the testimony of one who ought to know.&nbsp; What is
the reason?&nbsp; My informant tells me it is diminished parental
authority.&nbsp; Every day, mothers and fathers come to him with
boys of tender years, whom they declare to be utterly
unmanageable.&nbsp; Another cause undoubtedly is our cheap and
trashy literature.&nbsp; Recently, a great newsvendor stated
before a committee of the House of Commons, that he sold weekly
one hundred of &ldquo;The Black Monk,&rdquo; one hundred of
&ldquo;Blighted Heart,&rdquo; five hundred and fifty of
&ldquo;Claude Duval,&rdquo; fifty of &ldquo;The Hangman&rsquo;s
Daughter,&rdquo; and three hundred and fifty of &ldquo;Paul
Clifford.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you want to see what these boys read,
visit Kent Street or the New Cut.&nbsp; Look at the sensational
pictures of the cheap illustrated journals, in which murder,
suicide, <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>and crime are the staple commodities treated of.&nbsp;
Read some of the journals professedly written for boys, and which
you will see the boys read if you happen to pass any large
establishment at the dinner hour, and it will not be difficult to
understand what street boys, if left to themselves, are sure to
become.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
